Molweni everyone,<br>  <br>  Hope this email finds you in good health and spirits.<br>  <br>  For those of you who haven't heard through the grapevine yet, we will be leaving South Africa next week (aiming for the 4th of April). Due to a financial meltdown with Matt's company, the new management have finally decided to forego starting up the African office. We entertained the idea of staying on, with me continuing with my music teaching and running the literacy programme at a local township school, while Matt joined up with one of many of the renewable energy companies in SA who are taking advantage of the critical shortage of electricity in the country.<br>  <br>  But... our itchy feet won out and we have decided to take this unexpected opportunity to travel and explore more of Africa and beyond. So just a few days ago, we bought Foxy, a 1993 Land Rover 110 Defender, and right now she's getting fitted with some safety features and new (round!) wheels among other necessary gadgets to make us self-sufficient on the road. See pic of Foxy in attachment.<br>  <br>&#x9;Our plan is to head overland through Africa (SA, Nambia, Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda, DRC, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt), cross over into the Syria, Jordan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, France, and finally to London. We aim to be there by early August and after visiting the Thornington Family, we'll fly to Toronto/Ottawa to see the Wong Family before finally heading to Vancouver Island. Matt will be starting a 2 year Renewable Energy Technology course at Malaspina College in Nanaimo and I'll be hopefully working soon after arriving (any job contacts and recommendations are more than welcome here!)<br>  <br>  Part of our African journey will include a trip to Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, just on the border with Rwanda. Matt has a relative, Lyn Lusi, who along with her husband Jo, an orthopedic surgeon, founded and are now running HEAL AFRICA ( www.healafrica.org), a clinic for war victims. By all accounts it's a pretty amazing place doing vital work for the community and training new medical professionals. It was also recently visited by George Clooney in his role as UN ambassador. <br>  <br>  Also on our route is Hope Clinic Lukuli in Kampala (www.hcluganda.org), a clinic run by friends in Uganda, focusing primarily on philanthropic maternity child healthcare in the community.<br>  <br>  We are hoping to raise some funds and bring over some medical supplies in Foxy which are difficult to find in that part of the world. If you are interested in donating any amount to our cause, please send us an email as soon as possible so that we can purchase everything we need at once. After we've bought the supplies we'll let you know what has been bought and where it's going to. Both of the clinics also have NGO status so I think that makes donations tax-deductible so if you prefer you are also very welcome to go to their websites and donate directly to them.<br>&#x9;<br>  So, we may be out of reach for a few months, but do keep those emails coming - we promise we will get around to replying to everyone! We will hopefully be updating fairly regularly with pictures and stories; Matt found a satellite phone which he thinks can connect to Facebook ("Yayyy!!" he says). Or keep checking this blog for those of you who can take in more information than one status update at a time ;)<br>  <br>  For those of you who think will be staying or traveling close to our route and would like to meet up for drinks/dinner, send us an email with your up-to-date contact details and we'll try and meet up. It would be great to see some familiar faces en route, and we would have no trouble making little detours for hot showers and homemade meals! ;)<br>  <br>  To our new-found friends in Cape Town/SA, enkosi (thank you) for all the good times and fantastic memories. During the past 7 months, we've had the opportunity to explore this dynamic country and its 9 provinces, all so varied and beautiful in their own unique way. From rural towns to city centres, the hospitality and generosity we met were second to none and I will always remember Cape Town as a city of contrasts with laid-back, fun-loving and vibrant people, not to mention incredibly steep hills - which I cursed while trying to master hill starts in my manual car! Who knows, maybe we'll be back in 2010 for The World Cup!!??<br>  <br>  We will have a leaving party next week and we've bought paints for everyone to leave their mark on Foxy (but please nothing that might jeopardise our entry into Sudan, Syria etc!) but we have to wait for the garage to finish putting her back together first, then we'll let you Capetonians know when that will be happening.<br>  <br> Big smiles and warm hugs,<br>  <br>  Bonnie and Matt<br>  xoxo<br> <br>

Wow, the packers are here and i have nothing to do. Well, that's not strictly true. I could sort out all our gear for the trip but i'm just too exhausted. It's been a sweaty 40 degrees today and i feel sorry for the guys who have to pack our stuff. Due to some mis- communication, there wasn't enough boxes to put our stuff in and in any case, they had only gotten through about 80% of it. So they'll have to come back tomorrow and finish off the job. It feels good to get all our stuff out of the house - physically - so that we can mentally be on our way to starting our long-trek up to London. Tomorrow we continue.

Despite the darkness and a bit of paint spillage, we had a very successful painting-Foxy party tonight with friends. It's amazing what a little colour and creativity can do! Thanks Piyali, Gagun, Paul C., Maria, Gemma, Anna, Paul N., Gary, Franzelle and Etienne! Your beautiful artwork will certainly draw lots of positive attention throughout Africa! ps. Sorry about the ants in the pizza!

My hectic birthday began at 6:30am. Matt and I spent the day running around with the car, trying to get her little kinks sorted out. I did manage to sneak in a little ten minute power nap somewhere among the chaos, a little gift to myself. To celebrate, we spent a lovely evening with friends Gailyn and Craig (and the kids they were looking after) at the local Primi Piatti restaurant. We ate pizza (again!) and outrageously delicious chocolate brownies. This time last year i was being pampered at one of Hong Kong's top luxury spas overlooking the spectacular harbour; tonight I'm being cuddled and read to while lying on two foam mattresses on the floor of our very bare house.

This weekend we wanted to try out some 4x4 trails to test out Foxy's new rear diff lock and low range gears, break open our new high-lift jack and try sleeping in our roof-top tent. So late Saturday afternoon (after another day of running around and preparations), we drove 30 minutes north of Cape Town to Melkbos 4x4. This place was definitely not one of your usual charming and pretty South African campsites. It looked more like a junkyard with sand and litter and abandoned vehicles everywhere. No wonder there were no pictures on their website. Upon arriving, we realized our low range gear did not engage properly, and so there was no point in going on the trails. We had to get it fixed first. Still, wanting to make the best of it, we camped in our roof-top tent for the first time and with friends Maria and Paul joining us, cooked up a delicious braai dinner and sat around a big bonfire. Maria even remarked the "campsite" didn't look so bad in the dark - and after some wine and champagne. The next morning we woke up to some vicious wind and rain and unanimously decided to head off in search of a warm cozy cafe somewhere to have breakfast. In a way, the night was a good test to see if the tent could withstand all the wind and rain. I'm happy to report it did, beautifully. The only slight worry is a small tear forming on the one side of the canvas which will have to be repaired immediately. Another item to add to our ever- growing list! We found an open cafe (not easy to do on an early Sunday morning) and warmed up with hot coffee and cappuccinos. See pic of us chomping on cinnamon french toast and flapjacks, happy to be somewhere with four walls and a roof. I think we'll have to develop a bit more tolerance during our overland drive though since there won't be too many opportunities to escape to such comforts. Still. The day wasn't wasted as we managed to take apart the gear box and fix the low-range gear stick problem!! Bursting with pride as ad-hoc mechanics, we spent the rest of the day with Matt fixing the console box, amplifier for our sound system, hood latch, etc., and me sorting out all of our gear and equipment in piles. Our living room floor is bare no more! Now the real challenge lies in trying to strategically pack every single piece of item in Foxy to maximize her space and minimize hassle of finding that item when we desperately need it, like say, in the Serengeti desert. It's all coming together; i can chart our preparation progress, albeit slower than we want. But soon we shall be on the road, date still undetermined, and we'll know we will have done what we could to prepare for this journey.

SO much running around. SO much to do. Our list of to-do's is growing by the hour. We decided that TONIGHT will be our last night in Cape Town. As chance would have it, tonight was the night Hout Bay has its weekly scheduled power outage. So into town we went to have our last supper. We went back to one of our all-time favourite restaurants, Toni's on Kloof, and had some delicious Mozambican fish. On the whole medical-aid thing, I've been calling around desperately trying to find who stocks and sells medical supplies and equipment in bulk. Eventually, I got hold of the 3M representative for the Western Cape. What a fantastic woman! She gave us boxes of samples of steri-drapes, surgical masks, gauze, and even a few rolls of reflector tape! All for free! I've always believed that there are angels who appear when you need them most. Now it's confirmed. Thank you!

Our 11am departure was definitely over-optimistic. We were both too giddy with nerves and excitement that we just wanted to GET ON THE ROAD! Eventually we did. All in good time, as they say. By the time we sorted out everything (ie. security alarm disabling, handing over keys, last minute packing, returning our rental car, and the biggest thing of all, packing Foxy itself with all our gear and equipment), it was well past 5pm before we set off. See pics of everything we had to fit into Foxy. It was like playing one huge giant game of rubix cube. You could only move one piece if you moved another one first. Today, or rather, this evening, we tried to get as far out of Cape Town as possible, and ended up staying in a beautiful little organic farm's campsite between Citrusdal and Clanwilliam. We found it on our GPS using the "nearest campsite" function and the owner was a happy-go-lucky chap with wild curly hair and a quirky habit of saying "unbelievable" and "oh my goodness" every second phrase. He was so nice, you couldn't help but just smile. Since we arrived around 20:30, we couldn't see much but to compensate, we had a spectacular sky full of stars. It was too late to whip out the gas stove so we ate Pringles and tuna sandwiches before climbing into our rooftop tent for a sound sleep. Start: Hout Bay, SA. 17:00 End: halfway between Citrusdale and Clanwilliam, SA. 20:30 Distance Travelled: 260 km Road Conditions: smooth paved highway and then some dirt roads to farm Temperature: mild/hot day but due to all our packing and shifting boxes, it felt much hotter. Night quite cool.

We woke up after a peaceful night's slumber, super excited to actually BE on our trip and not just talking and planning about it. Whatever was left unfinished (or forgotten, more like) back in Cape Town will just have to go unfinished - or forgotten. When we climbed out of our tent this morning, we could see exactly how pretty the campsite was. Later on in the day during our drive we saw some spectacular sights of the Cederberg Wilderness Area and canyons and then the Clanwilliam dam. After realizing Foxy was WAY too overloaded from yesterday's short drive, we spent the entire morning unpacking and laying everything out on the grassy campsite. All this was stuff we had packed just 24 hours ago into her! We chucked out a good few kilos (books, utensils, Tupperware, heavy-duty chain and lock, thermos, towels, bedding, stuff I can't remember anymore and would rather not for fear of thinking I should've kept it). As difficult as it was to part with certain "things", it was quite liberating in a way. A kind of "spring cleaning" if you will. In the middle of summer. The "oh my goodness" man was very grateful and at least the stuff will be used by others. We finally hit the road when the sun was high and hot. We drove on and on, telling ourselves that Foxy was indeed that much lighter and more happy without all that unnecessary gear. By 17:30, the sun was setting fast so we turned into the Namaqualand Game Lodge we spotted from the road, just a few kms from Springbok. There was nobody else but us at the bush campsite, about 5 kms inland. Just us, nice flush toilets, an outdoor sink and the stars. We were warned of baboons who steal everything from food to shower curtains so we made sure we put everything back in Foxy before climbing into bed (a good habit to have anyways) just in case. Tonight we tried to cook using our new big gas canister and stove. We tried desperately to light it a dozen times at least but then realized it was EMPTY. Big oops. I had a hunch, seeing as it was quite light and I could hoist it above my head onto the roof. We suspect all the gas leaked out during the ride when the nozzle was accidentally knocked open. So "fill gas canister" was added to our list of things to do. We ended up using our small camping stoves and had some noodles and veg and fish. Start: halfway between Citrusdale and Clanwilliam, SA. 13:00 End: just south of Springbok, SA. 17:30 Distance Travelled: 377 km Road Conditions: gravel and smooth tar roads Temperature: We are loving Foxy's air vents, a LandRover Defender Trademark, which keep us cool even during the heat of the day. It feels like being on a motorcycle and having the wind blow on your face. Because we don't have A/C our tinted windows are a huge blessing as well. Good investment indeed. Night was quite chilly. Had to wear fleece and socks. Even Matt needed an extra fleece blanket besides our duvet! It was that chilly.

This morning we took only half the time getting ready than yesterday. In actual terms that's about 2 hours, but still, we consider it a success seeing as the day before that we took 6+ hours to "get ready". We are working better as a team: Me, Matt, and Foxy. We have our self-designated duties when we're driving and when we're stationary. We have our own "stations" too when we put up/take down the tent, cook, wash up, etc. A lot of people have remarked that doing an overland trip like this certainly puts any relationship to the test. We concur. It's all about communication, trust and r-e-s-p-e-c-t. And lots of dark Lindt chocolate and good music to pass the time! When everything you and your partner own at present is so closely associated with one vehicle, you do take extra precaution in doing things. I'm still learning Foxy's curves and grooves. I stopped counting the number of times I've hit my knee/elbow on one of her sharp edges. I keep discovering more everyday too. She may be a 15year old beauty, but she's got certain kinks and oddities that one just has to accept (or learn first, for that matter). It's like we're getting to know each other in very intimate ways. Our relationship is at the "working it out" stage but we're hopeful. I have to admit though, my arms and shoulders are getting quite the workout from opening her back door, hoisting all the boxes underneath the platform and not to mention the dozen times I have to hoist myself up daily on the ladder, on the side steps or up on the hood. She's a very tall and well-built jungle-gym and I'm the performing monkey! ;) Quick stop in Springbok to post last minute things from the post office and to pick up some beer and sweet red wine (in a box, so not to risk broken glass upon arrival). Then off we zipped to Vioolsdrif as quick as we possibly could to try and get across the Namibian/SA border and aim for Aus, a small town famous for spotting feral horses. All the procedures were quite smooth, considering it was our first border crossing with Foxy. Unfortunately ESKOM wasn't on our side at all. While we were getting all our VAT invoices processed (we get back 14% on all the goods we purchased in SA if we can show the items to the customs guard... this is a huge lump sum payment which would be a happy addition to our depleting wallets), the power went out. So the nice man processing our invoices couldn't compute it all. When the power started up again after about 10 minutes, he had to start all over again. And then it went out AGAIN! So instead of waiting and wasting the day away, we had all our invoices stamped "deficiency due to power outage" and were told to process them at the office in Windhoek. Oh well. We bid farewell to South Africa and off we went to Aus! Not quite. The Fish River bridge was closed (high floods apparently), so we took a secondary route to Ai-Ais (gateway to the Fish River Canyon) to get some diesel (we were running low and had to siphon some from our reserve tank). Ai-Ais was closed due to renovations so we had to turn around. While trying to decipher Namibia's road numbering, I took us in the wrong direction back towards the border! 60 precious kilometres were lost because of it. This is when drawing that "patience" card is vital between couples. Lucky for me I still had a few in reserve! ;) SO... assessing our situation: we had half a bottle of water left between us, less than half a tank of diesel, the sun was quickly setting, no cars in sight (apparently Namibia is one of Africa's lowest population densities having only 2 people per square km!) and we still didn't know where we would be camping that night. Not a good situation to be in. Add to that these huge black long-legged jumpy things that were ALL over the road which looked slightly threatening. Lesson learned. Eventually we got back on the main Namibian highway (B1) and stopped in Grunau for the night. We immediately filled our main and reserve fuel tank, bought 5 L jug of water and filled up Foxy's water tank to the brim. Relaxed now that we had found a campsite (equipped with braai pit, private shower and toilet), we had a lovely broewors dinner with canned beans and veggies. Why does food taste so much better after a long day's drive? I'm trying to keep a very up to date record of our trip: fuel consumption, fuel prices, fuel efficiency, where we spent the night, what happened at each border crossing, what we ate, what we saw... we'll see how it goes. So far so good, but it's only the third day. Start: south of Springbok, SA. 10:00 End: Grunau, NAM. 18:20 Distance Travelled: 454 km Road Conditions: smooth highway in SA and then packed gravel in NAM. Temperature: daytime is hot and dry, thank goodness. But VERY hot and VERY dry. Nights are cool with slight breeze, very agreeable.

The longest driving day yet. We woke up to traffic noise early in the morning. In a country that is so vast, why did we choose to camp beside its busiest highway? To try and make up lost time and distance from yesterday's 'scenic route', we picked the most direct route to get up to Sessriem Campsite at Sossusvlei. I obviously got up on the right side of the tent because we didn't get lost once. Little lanky towns dot Namibia's arid land. A town on Namibia's map is actually a couple of wooden structures, a hollowed out tractor or truck and if you're lucky, one pump offering diesel. We passed some awesome canyons, dry moonlike landscapes and huge boulder-fields where it looks like some big giant just scooped them up and placed them there. Namibia's famous for their quiver trees, stumpy looking trunks with wiry branches that are twisted in every possible fashion. See pic. When we got closer to the Namib desert, the scenery was just incredible. Grassy hills and white-washed fields were as far as the eye could see. Once in a while, you could spot red-coloured dunes on top of certain hills, which made you realize you were getting closer to the desert and that all this isn't just a dream. We passed herds of cows, sheep, springbok, ostrich and kudu on our way, looking very healthy and free. We arrived at Sessrium campsite exhausted. After paying our hefty camping fee of 770 Namibian dollars (!!!), we sped towards the dunes to catch the last glimpse of the setting sun. However, we didn't realize that climbing one dune meant that there was a higher one to climb after that, and a higher one after that, and... yeah, it was like chasing the end of a rainbow. Uphill. Fortunately we thought ahead and we each brought a can of Coke (me) and Amstel (Matt) for our sunset reward. It was stunning. And to think it happens every day. That night we had a shower (bliss) and cooked up dinner using our small camping stove. I must say we are getting super slick at cooking using only one pot. First you boil the water, add the frozen fish and frozen veggies, wait till it boils, add some noodles, drain and add curry sauce and heat until ready. I'm loving the ease and simplicity of it all, and the minimal washing up afterwards. While I've become so-called designated "chef", Matt has won the title of "human washing machine". We bought this big yellow plastic tub at a sailing shop in Cape Town before we left and it has got to be one of the best investments so far. Every night we place our dirty clothes in this yellow bucket, add a bit of water and OMO washing detergent, let it slosh around in Foxy during our day's bumpy drive and at the end of the day, rinse out the clothes and let it hang to dry. It's only Day 4 and Matt's done 2 washes already! We think we may need to buy a new jerry can though since when we're not using it as a washing machine, we are siphoning diesel into it to pour into the main gas tank. It isn't so pretty when your underwear smells like Omo and diesel. Super tired after a hot day's driving on gravel, we climbed into our cozy tent at 20:00. Matt was snoring within 10 seconds of his head hitting the pillow (I am not exaggerating). I managed to read a bit of my book before turning off my headtorch. Start: Grunau, NAM. 8:27 End: Sossusvlei, NAM. 17:00 Distance Travelled: 604 km Road Conditions: hard gravel, some corrugation Temperature: hot, in a dry kind of way

The alarm woke us up at 4:15. It was still pitch black out, stars shining brightly. But up we got, folded the tent and got Foxy fired up. We waited in line with the other dozen or so cars for the gate to open and then raced off into the dunes again for sunrise. We were bracing ourselves for an even bigger dune-climb than yesterday's, but in fact there was none of that at all! We drove on to Dune 45 and when the paved road ended, continued on the sandy tracks. Foxy LOVED that and performed elegantly. We parked her just at Deadvlei lot and walked around, snapping pics of the beautiful dunes and their morning colours. We left the desert and entered hills and mountain passes. There was still very little traffic. When there was any sign of life, it was often a donkey-cart and families loaded with gear and children. Entering Windhoek was like being back in civilization. We arrived at the Arebbusch Campsite and Lodge around 14:00, cooked up a late lunch in their sparkling-clean kitchen, hung out our third load of laundry since beginning our trip just 5 days ago and caught up on a bit of email and news with their wireless internet. Tonight we met up with friend Angela. We first met when we went to see her open house in Cape Town. That was back in the day when we thought purchasing a house in South Africa was a good investment. Lucky we didn't go through with that! She and her husband run a Leadership/Coaching company and from time to time she works in Windhoek. It was lovely to meet again. Angela took us to Joe's Beer House, a must-do for any tourist here, or local for that matter. It has this old rustic feel to it, with toilet-bar seats, old bicycles and baskets hung everywhere, old wooden picnic tables and camping chairs, and some very tasty game meat on the menu. Matt had the "Fire in the Bush" meal. And when it came, the waitress lit the little shot glass of paraffin which was then poured all over the "bush" (or sliced potatoes). Oh, and there was also a piece of barbed wire with a hot pepper attached to it as d&#xE9;cor on the plate. Strange. Very Namibian??!! Start: Sossusvlei, NAM. 5:00 End: Windhoek, NAM. 14:00 Distance Travelled: 472 km Road Conditions: gravel sometimes corrugated, then smooth paved highway Temperature: still a nice dry heat. Evening chilly and breezy. No complaints. But needed extra fleece blankets and sleeping bag to keep warm.

Just a quick entry here because this is the only day on the trip I didn't write about and I'm a "kampekishugisha", or so says Matt. Hint: it's a Japanese word. Basically, today Matt sent about 20 kilos worth of clothes, books, etc to Cape Town to be added to our shipment for Vancouver. These are things we couldn't bear to part with but couldn't bring along on our trip. I went to the VAT office and got all the forms filled out since we couldn't process it at the SA/NAM border due to the power outages. So hopefully within the year we'll get a nice lump sum back. That's it. Don't remember much more.

Last night i had a violent spell of je-ne-sais-quoi and spent the day lying in the tent. I blame it on the salad i had yesterday at Cafe Schneider in Windhoek town. No more raw veg for me, thanks. Tonight Matt went to visit an old highschool friend, Papso, in his home. A Namibian working with NTC, he cooked up a nice curry chicken for dinner. Or so i'm told. I'm sorry I couldn't meet them also. See pic of Papso and his wife with their 6 month old daughter in the background photo. Start: - End: - Distance Travelled: 0 km Road Conditions: - Temperature: couldn't say, except that i had a fever so it all seemed rather hot

Packing up today felt great, we were on the move again! First stop was an electric workshop where we were hoping to get our fuel pump working again. This would eliminate any messy siphon mishaps; instead we could just turn on the fuel pump and fuel would be pumped from our reserve tank to the main tank. See pic of man fixing our pump. We were told (again!) how messy a job the guys we bought Foxy from did, leaving wires open and tangled like a bird's nest, just basically not doing as good a job as it could - and should - be. Landrovers are known to be great simple machines where pretty much any mechanic could look at one and fix whatever was wrong with it. Instead, the guys who had owned Foxy previously fixed things in their own way which makes it that much more difficult for others to diagnose and fix. Crossing into Botswana was almost too easy. We were finished everything in under 30 minutes. No lineups, no fussy questions, no bribes necessary. Very efficient and civilized. A good sign of things to come? We certainly hope so. Because there were no campsites on the Botswana side of the border, we kept driving even though it was getting dark. Eventually we reached Ghanzi where we had the choice of several bush lodges and campsites. Luckily we managed to call in advance at one of the camps before the reception closed at 10pm. We parked Foxy, brushed our teeth and collapsed into bed. It seemed to be a fairly deserted campsite, but we weren't alone. There were two ostriches, who were sleeping literally a couple of metres away, and looked like two big huge grey boulders. When we started to open and close Foxy's creaky doors, their long necks gently raised up, eyes squinty and only then did i realize they were ostriches. No fear of being bitten or chased though, they just lowered their heads and went back to sleep. Start: Windhoek, NAM. 12:00 End: Ghanzi, BOT. 22:15 Distance Travelled: 558 km Road Conditions: good Temperature: the usual hot day and cold night

After another good night's sleep, we packed up and went into Ghanzi town to gas up. There, we met two friends who were motorbiking from Luanda, Angola to Lusaka, Zambia. We also met Kozi, a 23 year old Japanese hitchhiker who was taking 5 years to "travel the world without using the airplane". What a spunky little guy he was. His pack was literally bigger than him! For a solo-traveler, he had all the perks: ipod, laptop, cooking supplies, Japanese chocolate-flavoured straws (which he gave us as a thank you present), a one-man tent and a padlock for the tent - which seems a bit funny considering anyone could come along and slash it open if they so pleased. Kozi was going to Maun as well so we pushed some bags around in the back compartment and he sat there for the day's ride, providing us with some funny stories about his travels through Tibet, Mongolia, Australia, etc. We decided to camp at the Sedia Hotel in Maun. I picked it out from our trusty LP (Lonely Planet) out of all the places listed because it boasted "all the amenities you could want like big continental swimming pool and internet access but still cheap camping in the back lot". But seeing how filthy the pool was, my first impression were not great at all. Still, seeing how hot the day was and how much we were looking forward to going for a swim, in we got! Cooked up another humble meal: canned veg + canned mutton curry + udon noodles (a treat!) and some Japanese fish-based soup. Start: Ghanzi, BOT. 11:45 End: Maun, BOT. 17:08 Distance Travelled: 310 km Road Conditions: long stretches of paved road, littered with cows, goats, Hunter dogs, squirrels, etc. Temperature: dry and dusty. oh and of course, hot.

The past few days have been filled with crazy camp dogs, long stretches of excellent Botswana's roads (can't go faster than 80 kmp due to all the roaming cattle, goats, wild painted dogs, donkeys), and today we took a day trip on the local mokoro (traditional dugout canoe) in the Moreni Park. You cannot get much more relaxing than doing a mokoro ride. Each mokoro holds two passengers, their gear and a poler (person who stands and 'poles' you around the networks or waterways). It was incredibly relaxing to just sit or lay back with the sun shining down on your face, sound of the pole dipping into the water. Once in a while a motor boat would pass and we would stop and wait in the reeds before proceeding. Lots of gorgeous white, yellow and purple lilies. Did i mention how relaxing it was? It is the dry season now but they had quite an abnormally wet dry season so luckily we were able to actually do the mokoro trip in the first place. Our poler, Joe, was a young lad who said he enjoyed the job but that it was 'too easy'. 'Monotonous' was the word he was probably looking for. That, and maybe 'boring'. But for the passengers, it is just incredibly peaceful and relaxing. I presume it earns him a fairly good income though. The other poler for the other mokoro (we went with two other guys, friends who were motorbiking from Luanda, Angolo to Lusaka, Zambia), Joseph, was older, more knowledgeable and extremely more chatty. He seemed to enjoy his job quite a lot and he took us to his village, Borro, where he showed us "my very own solar panel!!" There, we also met Esther, a single woman who was constructing her own house out of termite hill mud. Desperately wanting to get my hands in the muck as well, I asked to help and slap on a bit of the mud. She was very kind and let me do so. Great fun! After lunch, Joseph took us on a "short bush walk" which was really a long drawn-out stroll in the mid-day heat. "All the animals sleep or stay in the shadow during the middle of the day so we may not see anything today" explains Joseph. I'm wondering why we're not sleeping or staying in the shadow as well. But onwards we trekked. If anyone was looking, it would've been a funny sight to behold: 4 tourists and their trusty guide walking in single-file into the bush in search for ?, not even a fly in sight. But by some miracle, Joseph spotted a young male elephant in the distance. In the FAR FAR distance. It still amazes me how these guys can spot game from miles away. We aimed to get as close as possible to the elephant, walking through more bushland, passing dozens of termite hills and the occasional tree. At about 50 metres away, we watched and observed the elephant for a while. It actually was really exciting to be spying on him as he kicked up mounds of dirt to mix with water, creating a mud-like substance to coat himself with. It was all so very natural, peaceful and yes, relaxing. On the mokoro ride back, we passed more hippos and then about 1 km down from them, we passed a group of tourists who were in the middle of doing some water aerobics amongst all the lilies and reeds! I asked our guides if we could go for a quick dip also, so in we went, a perfect refreshing end to our perfect relaxing day. Start: - End: - Distance Travelled: 0 km Road Conditions: - Temperature: a beautifully hot day spent in the cool water channels of the Okavango Delta.

A little comment on Sedia Hotel. The LP's author must have stayed here a while back because their standards have dropped, fallen, plummeted. Yes, the campsite was big and open, but they failed to mention just how LOUD and OBNOXIOUS it can get when there are parties going on until past 2am in nearby chalets or discos. Or the fact that their so-called luxurious pool was covered in a layer of grease and dirt at the bottom and a layer of white unidentifiable filmy substance on top. Still, I went in for a quick dip on the first night. Internet cafe only accessible from 8-5pm and not on weekends (hence me updating from a local internet cafe in Maun town now, blasted with cold air-con and listening to Bryan Adams' "Please Forgive Me" on perpetual repeat). Oh and let me not start on the topic of their two camp dogs. Two straggly looking creatures with sharp teeth and claws and no understanding of "NO", "GO AWAY", other rather rude comments and gestures. For some reason, they were instantly attracted to us and Foxy and any minute we were outside around the campsite, you could bet one or both of them were following you close behind. A few times the bigger dog tried to bite me and did so successfully once. I yelled and pretended I was just about to kick him but he did not flinch. At night when we were cooking, they would just extend their body as far as they possibly could in the most inconvenient of places, like right in our cooking station. Matt hung our washing out on his homemade washing line, but soon after, we realized socks and boxers were being pulled and ripped apart from the line. A great washing line, but in the end we had to take it down; we couldn't risk losing more clothing since we now had literally only enough to last us the trip. We didn't take into account crazy dogs who steal underwear. Overall, I'm unimpressed with Sedia Hotel. We both agreed it felt good to pack up our tent and supplies this morning and motor on out. Out plan today is to finish off our quickie internet session here and head north to Chobe National Park, just adjacent to Moremi Park. According to our map, in 28 kms we hit the Moremi Park entrance at Shorobe where we continue on 4x4 sandy tracks until we get to Chobe. I've stocked up on cool drinks (Coke, Coke Light, juice) and bought myself a tiny 350 ml flask to keep my hot water for morning coffee. It was a mistake to be so hasty in throwing away my thermos on Day Two in Clanwilliam. Since Matt doesn't drink coffee in the morning, it's just me who heats up a bit of water to make myself instant Nestcafe. Instead, we figure we could cut down on at least 10 minutes of morning preparation by heating up the water after cooking dinner the night before, storing it in the flask and using it for my morning cafe. Ok, i'm just writing whatever comes to mind right now and so apologies for useless information like coffee flasks. I think this internet cafe in Maun is getting to me. It's a tiny narrow room with 8 computers crammed side by side, and customers are blasted with freezing cold air-con and Bryan Adams' "Please Forgive Me" on perpetual repeat. Hang on, I've already mentioned that. Right, time to go. We've got a big load of laundry sitting in our big yellow plastic bucket, ready to be bounced and stirred around on a bit of off-roading today. Let's see what we see today.

What a day! Leaving Maun was the best thing we could've done. Things just got better and better. After negotiating river crossings, sandy rutted 'roads', and a few unmarked detours, we made it to Savuti Camp just as the sun was gently setting. We even timed it so well we drove the last 50 kms or so during the best time of the day to see game. I don't know what I was expecting, but I certainly wasn't expecting to see as many animals as we did. Minutes after hitting the sand/gravel road, the scenery changed from bushy, thorny, shrubby grassland to dense trees and marshy swamps. Foxy was amazing on these roads and it was like second nature to her. And despite my "Don't be a hero" warnings to Matt, he was an excellent driver, negotiating the tough terrain magnificently. All of a sudden I spot two huge elephants drinking at the watering hole we just whizzed past. "STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Lucky Foxy's not a quiet car whatsoever and my sudden outburst wasn't as loud as it could've seemed. I made Matt do a U-turn and we sat quietly beside the watering hole watching the elephants drink and then wade in the water. I was mesmerized. Little did i know we would be spotting elephants, giraffes, wildebeests, guinea fowl, and dozens of species of birds all throughout the day. This was just the beginning. The highlight for both of us was when off in the distance, we saw a creature stroll casually across the sandy road. As we approached we saw that it was a cheetah, and he was now sitting in the bushes just a few car lengths away! We paused to take a few pictures, careful not to make any sudden movements. Feeling incredibly fortunate to have spotted him, we drove away slowly. Wow. Unbelievable. The other exciting, but slightly annoying, event was about 15 kms from our destination, when we had to stop for about 30 minutes and wait for an elephant to get off the road. He was eating the grass from both sides without a care in the world, and when we tried to approach him to inch past, he turned towards us and flared his ears and trunk at us. We bid a hasty retreat to gave him some space, and waited (somewhat) patiently. We arrived at Savuti Campsite and after assessing Foxy and all that was inside, the only thing that didn't survive our bumpy trek was a few yogurt containers which had busted en route and leaked all over the inside of the fridge. No big deal. While cleaning up the spilled yogurt, two long-legged, elegant creatures (not sure, it could've been kudu or something else, haven't mastered recognizing our antelope yet) sprinted past us, just metres away. It seemed they were running away from some potential danger. Incredible! After cleaning up and a quick shower in the dark (no electricity in the ablutions, although there was a massive solar panel), we gathered some firewood nearby and got busy building our campfire and cooking our standard curry meal. Camping tonight was the true essence of "bush camping". With no electricity, no garbage cans (all visitors must burn their rubbish) and open plains and nearby forests, we heard a symphony of animal sounds all night. Fantastic. This beats any loud bass-thumping music like a couple of nights ago. We left all our windows open on the tent (except for the mesh of course) just in case we could spot some game. However, one must be AWAKE in order to see any animals. That was our only downfall. Stars, full moon, campfire, laughing hyenas (?) in the distance.... Matt summed it up in three words: "This is Africa." On a closing note, I have now proudly joined the official "Beer Guzzling" club. I cannot even describe how my throat was just simply parched when we pulled into Savuti Campsite. We both pulled out a Windhoek beer from the fridge (i don't know what we would have done without it) and without thinking, I chugged mine back in mere seconds. For those who aren't aware, I'm not usually a beer drinker and certainly not a guzzler. But this was an exception. Of course, this was followed by our synchronized chorus of burps and satisfied sighs. Start: Maun, BOT. 11:51 End: Savuti, BOT. 18:15 Distance Traveled: 206 km Road Conditions: sandy, sometimes deep, sometimes not. A bit like being in a boat, rocking side to side while staying in the grooves. Temperature: HOT day, perhaps a little self-induced with all the worrying and butt clenching due to the road conditions (see above)

A little celebration is in order: this morning we got up and ready and were on the road, all in under an hour! We even had time to savour the hot coffee in the new flask (me) and complete a final spin cycle on our washing (Matt). Setting up/putting down the tent is almost like second nature now, and every bag, equipment, piece of paper and even shoes have their own place in Foxy. There is still a lot of gear and equipment (and food) we could get rid of but it is definitely a huge improvement from a week ago. With breakfast on the go (smoked kudu and cream cheese sandwiches, courtesy of deli in Maun), we were off! More sandy roads, but this time corrugated. It felt like we were riding outside the wake being pulled behind a motorboat, like when you water ski. We reached Kasane around noon, filled up our gas tanks (diesel is much cheaper in Botswana than in Zambia) and filled out all the proper documents to cross into Zambia. Crossing into Zambia on the Zambezi was quite amusing. I consider ourselves lucky though as it was during our ferry crossing (on this huge pontoon-type platform) where one of the prop shaft literally came apart on the engine. The poor people waiting on the other side would be stuck for an indefinite time now. We still made it across ok, but that sent many screaming passengers running for the life jackets. Trying to process our documents on the Zambian side is an episode I would like to forget very soon. So much for the smooth and relaxed procedures like in Botswana! Loud, chaotic, hot and disorganized. Not to mention bloody expensive. Btw, what is carbon tax? I'm going to find out as we had to pay 150,000 Kwacha for it. arg. Arriving in Livingstone, we checked into the lovely Waterfront Campsite (with free wireless) and went to see Victoria Falls and its moonbow (a rainbow seen in the light of a full moon). We lucked out as we didn't realize it was a full moon tonight. Unfortunately none of our pictures turned out as we hoped. However, we did get some shots of us getting absolutely soaked from the Fall's spray. Absolutely incredible, the mighty Victoria Falls. Absolutely magnificent. Start: Savuti, BOT. 7:20 End: Livingston, ZAM. 15:00 Distance Traveled: 256 km Road Conditions: sandy corrugated ruts, gravel, good tar. In Zambia, surprisingly very good so far. Temperature: a hot day made hotter by hot tempered border guards. No need for sleeping bag at night. Lots of mosquitoes though.

I'm sitting at the Waterfront Campsite, overlooking the Zambezi River. From here, I can see the "smoke that thunders" just down the way, the impressive Victoria Falls. Matt's gone into town with Foxy to try and get a gas bracket fitted to the back of the car in order to hold our (now full) gas canister. We used it the other night and it works like a gem. Last night we had a meal out, our first together since we left Cape Town! It was wonderful, such a luxury to sit down at a table and eat a hot meal with a fork AND knife! With Zambian MTV blaring in the corner, we shared a plate of chicken nachos and i had chicken curry and rice. Only halfway into my meal did i realize how silly it seems to have ordered CURRY when that is our staple meal every night anyway. Still, it was oh so tasty. I'm still trying to get my head around the Zambian currency here, the Kwacha (ZMK). At the exchange rate of $1US = 3500 ZMK, i've got to train my brain to divide with multiple zeroes. I'm starting to feel that only now are we entering "the real Africa", what most people imagine "Africa" to be: thatch roof huts, lots of wandering livestock, dirt roads, baobab trees. Perhaps i'm comparing a lot of what i see here to my time in West Africa, but despite the "typical Africa" that is evident around here, there are also a surprising number of well-known shops/stores like Spar (grocery store), Shell Station, Steers and Nando's (fast food), even a Subway! It certainly feels like we've been on the road longer than 12 days. So much has happened. So much happens every day. It's only on R&#x26;R days like today where we can catch up on email, upload our pictures and reflect on the past events. No complaints here as I sit overlooking the peaceful Zambezi, warm breeze blowing, free wireless internet(!)and cups of Rooibos tea. Tomorrow we are aiming for an early start, heading towards Lusaka and then on the Eastern Highway to Chipata. En route, we will stay in Katete, where Guy (Matt's dad) will be spending 3 weeks in August volunteering with the Jersey Volunteers, digging trenches and building a school for the locals. We want to check it out and see what Katete's like. When he returns to Jersey with stories about "this bar" or "that shop" we'll be able to picture it as well. It's always nice to have someone from home understand a bit of where you've been, even just a little connection.

This afternoon, after having our gas canister holder welded to the back of our ladder, we decided to pay Vic Falls one last visit - during daylight. It was back onto Knife's Edge Bridge, where we tried in vain to stay somewhat dry by wearing our waterproofs. No such luck. We got just as soaked as last night. We also hiked down the path to Boiling Pots, deep in the gorge where the view from below is absolutely stunning. Up above you can see the bridge that connects Zimbabwe to Zambia. You can walk across it and get your passport stamped in Zim, but we thought considering all of the drama going on across the border it wasn't such a good idea. To escape the vicious mosquitoes, we opted to eat out tonight. In search of the Indian Tandoori restaurant, we found out that they were closed Mondays so instead we tried this little African restaurant, Ngoma Zanga. It was tastefully decorated inside, with excellent service and simply delicious local food - at tourist prices ;) Now we're back, ready for bed. Off to dream of hippos. Goodnight.

Some call Zambia "the real Africa" due to its "sparse untouched population" and fairly big land mass. With only a mere 15 people per square km and 45% of them living in the cities, we didn't see too many people on our route while traveling the long distances mentioned in our LP. The people we did see were busy carrying firewood or water to/from their home. Being a land-locked country, it seems that the major roads are just connecting the villages, dot to dot. In 2005, Zambia was one of the African countries deemed a Heavily Indebted Poor Country and so most of its $7 billion US debt was eliminated. Still, the country suffers from high unemployment, a rapid population growth rate, and a government which is plagued with corruption and political shena****ns since it became independent in 1964. Still, the biggest dilemma remains, that of HIV/AIDS, where it is estimated that 35% of the population is infected. With a lot of big trucks and transport vehicles careening up and down the road, making every town and village a potential "trucker's stop", one can easily see how it can bring about good business, but also spread HIV. According to the LP, due to the chronic HIV/AIDS dilemma, life expectancy is a horrific 33 years old. We saw a lot of evidence of HIV/AIDS campaigning, urging people to "play it safe" and to reaffirm "AIDS doesn't discriminate. Get Tested". After the road from Livingstone to Zimba, i thought i would need to buy myself a little rubber ring to sit on from then on. There were more potholes than smooth road. But then suddenly, after we passed Zimba, shining in the distance was silky smooth tar road, painted lines and all! I have to admit i was very impressed. Tonight we camped at Eureka Camp, just a few km south of Lusaka city. There was a sweet retired British couple who were also doing an overland trip. They had their 4x4 shipped to Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania and were meandering their way to South Africa over a few months. Their plan was to ship their car to Singapore afterwards and sometime next year fly down and explore SE Asia overland. It's always nice to meet others doing a similar journey, visiting similar places and even sleeping in the same Eezi-Awn rooftop tent! Eureka Camp was a nice spread out kind of place. We bought some fresh meat from the bar/restaurant and braai'd it to perfection over the last of our charcoals. Divine. While going to the toilets for one last visit before turning in for the night, we heard the 1st leg of the Semi Finals between Liverpool and Chelsea being aired on TV in the bar! And we were told it would be on April 30th! Apparently that is the when the 2nd leg will be played. So along with a few other tourists and locals, we watched the game which concluded in the devastating own-goal (a header no less!) by Liverpool's John Arne Riise at the last possible second. Shame! There was nothing more to do but go to bed............. Start: Livingstone, ZAM. 8:48 End: Lusaka, ZAM. 17:15 Distance Traveled: 489 km Road Conditions: horrendous pot-holed road from Livingstone to Zimba, and then pretty smooth sailing from there. There does some to be some evidence of road works being done, so that is positive. Temperature: rather cool.

This morning before we set off for Katete, we tried to find a Landrover workshop that could check out the transmission oil which seems to be slowly leaking and causing a bit of concern. After a few failed attempts of locating one on our GPS, we came across a shop behind a big warehouse, along a side street. Very random but the friendly mechanic was very knowledgeable and eased our worries by saying the oil level was just fine. Lusaka is a wide leafy city with easy-to-navigate roads and roundabouts, wrapped in a sense of ease and comfort. We both remarked that besides Cape Town, the other major cities we've passed so far (ie.Windhoek) all wouldn't be such a bad place to live. There were some interesting communist-type buildings which some may think look rather odd and distasteful, but I thought it added to the attraction of the city. Despite diesel being the highest in practically the entire continent, we decided to fill up our tanks "just in case". At least we got the cheapest rate in Lusaka at 6475 ZKW per litre. Once you leave the city, the price skyrockets. The Great East Road towards Chipata (via Katete) was a lot less populated than yesterday's busy Livingstone to Lusaka stretch. I've been amused by all the mini-buses and trucks that we've come across with messages splashed along their front windscreen and/or back window, many with religious overtones. Some of them which stick in my mind are: "God is Near", "FBI", "Have mercy", and my favourite, "Extra punch, extra pleasure." The scenery was pretty spectacular today as we passed fields of maize and sunflowers (biodisel seems to be a booming business here), villages selling locally-made baskets and mats, along with charcoal, sugar cane and firewood. There were a few police road blocks but after asking us where we were coming from (Cape Town) and where we were headed to (London - which always provoked a look of astonishment/confusion), they just waved us on with a friendly smile. With the sun setting behind us, we passed endless rolling hills covered in lush green vegetation (the heavy rainy season just ended) and after we crossed the Luangwa Suspension Bridge where kids were washing in the river below, we rolled into Katete just in time for dinner. We both ordered nshima and a "relish" (a type of sauce, either fish, beef, chicken, etc.) For dessert, I tried their "piece of cake", homemade goodness with sweet icing. To Matt's dismay, there was no beer to be bought! Not even good old Mosi, the local lager. No matter, we had one last can in our fridge which was quickly consumed before bedtime. The electricity went off right when the sun dipped behind the hills (didn't ask why so not sure if it's a regular thing), so we passed the evening outlining our route on Foxy's Africa Map using our headtorches. I tried to draw the countries to be able to distinguish our route better. It's exciting being able to see how far we've come already. And how much more there was still to come. Start: Lusaka, ZAM. 10:56 End: Katete, ZAM. 17:30 Distance Traveled: 532 km Road Conditions: more pot-holes, passed some incredible mountain passes and small villages, mostly selling charcoal, firewood, woven baskets and mats. Temperature: cool, although no need for sleeping bag at night.

This morning we woke up to the coldest weather yet on our trip! We put everything on we practically had. We were told later that Katete is one of three of the coldest areas in Zambia. Besides some home-made soap and postcards, I bought one of the shawls which was weaved by a Tiko volunteer. It's beautifully crafted and very warm. Although we could've had cereal and bread for breakfast from our Foxy stash, it felt only right to continue sampling Tikondane's menu and report back to Guy ;) Although it took a while for our food to come, the wait was worthwhile. I had a delicious omelette with bread while Matt had mashed sweet yam, sausages and fried eggs. We drank some instant coffee with hot fresh milk. Apparently they even produce and sell their own soy milk! While we were enjoying our meal, Sheila Dix and her companion (Brian, the bishop's son) came in. Sheila is the representative from Jersey Overseas Aid who is here to take pictures of the site and to organize a bit of what the volunteers will be doing when they arrive in August. It was interesting to chat to her and to hear about the projects they've been involved in. Besides having contributed to Tikondane and the St. Francis Hospital for several years, they have also sent volunteers to Uganda and Kenya, among other developing countries around the world. After breakfast, Matt and I walked over to the St. Francis Hospital where we were given a tour of the premises by hospital worker, Lucas. From what we saw, the hospital is incredibly well laid-out and well-maintained. We were impressed with the facilities, the equipment, and the staff in general. Along with her highly trained and professional team, executive director Dr. Parkinson (who was in a rush to get to her board meeting), seemed to have put enormous efforts into making and sustaining one of Zambia's most successful hospitals here in Katete. Just a few weeks ago, a man in a wheelchair came from Malawi for treatment. Back at Tikondane, we packed up Foxy and prepared ourselves for an easy 80km ride to Chipata, Sheila and Brian came up to us and told us they finally found out what the Jersey Overseas Team will be doing when they come. Because Sister Elke was "out on tour" for 3 months back in her native Australia, it was difficult to get any reliable information. However, it seems that the Team will be completing a half-finished hall just behind the guesthouses at Tikondane. Apparently some Guernsey funds were sent last year to build the great hall, which is supposed to hold a few hundred school children and their activities, but not enough to complete the building. So there it lies, with half built brick walls and a sheet of corrugated iron for a roof. It will certainly be an impressive building when it is finished and I can't wait to see the fruits of the Jersey Volunteers' labour. Overall, I've been very impressed with the entire project and how it's run. It is one of those little gems in Africa where grassroot development has gone right for all the right reasons. I'm in the middle of reading a book called "The Trouble with Africa" by Robert Calderisi, purchased at a bookstore in Windhoek. I protested at first about buying a new book when we had just sent about 8 books back to our shipping container in Cape Town to reduce Foxy's volume and weight. But it looked too good to pass up and Matt didn't need to convince me for very long. It's an excellent read if anyone is interested in aid relief and what exactly went/is going wrong with aid work in Africa. Though he is quite direct, frank and harsh, one of the points he mentions is how one of the best possible development efforts are when it's local-to-local aid. Instead of having money funnelling from big international NGO's to African government officials, to then be distributed to the locals, having regular willing citizens contribute (either by money, materials or labour is still a debatable subject) to other willing citizens proves to be the most efficient, corrupt-free, and direct form of aid. And isn't the case anywhere? Don't we normally tend to give when the matter is closer to our hearts? After posting some postcards at the very bare Katete post office, we sailed onwards to Chipata on the newly-paved highway. After spending about an hour trying to locate a couple of the guesthouses and campsites which were listed in our guidebooks, we decided in the end to press on to the Malawi border post, just a few km east. I was secretly hoping we wouldn't have to face another border post until tomorrow, fearing the worst, but in the end continuing onto Lilongwe (capital of Malawi) was the best decision we made. I could hardly believe how incredibly fast and easy - and cost FREE - the whole procedure was. No visa fee, no car fee, no silly carbon tax! Literally you blink and it's all over! It was like a magician had waved his wand over us and poof, we were in Malawi. Magic. Whizzing through the last hundred or so kms to Lilongwe on amazingly smooth road, we noticed that the number of people and bicycles nearly tripled. We camped in the backpacker's lodge of Mabuya, close to the city-centre. It was the first time where we met a lot of independent travelers criss-crossing around Africa, most using public transport. As luck would have it, we met George from the island of Sark, who had taken his motorbike all the way down the Middle East and Africa, eventually aiming for SA. What a Channel Islands day we had; we started it off by meeting a woman from Jersey and ended it by listening to tales from a young Sark traveler while eating canned curry and veg, finishing it off with bottles of Carlsburg Beer (fyi: Blantyre in Malawi is the only place in Africa to have a Carlsburg brewery). From what George told us (ie "Zanzibar was just too easy and predictable for me"), I gather he's quite an adventurer and one of those people who actually craves continuous excitement. But he's had his share of accidents on his trip, but they were not all unwelcome. Apparently after one horrific motorbike fall in southern Ethiopia, he came across an overland group of young beautiful nurses who provided all the sympathy and care he could dream of, and just having spent weeks crossing Sudan where men have little contact with women, meeting the nurses were sure a welcome sight! Start: Katete, ZAM. 11:31 End: Lilongwe, MAL. 16:45 Distance Traveled: 275 km Road Conditions: smooth tar road all the way to Lilongwe, well marked and all. Temperature: COLD turning to a pleasant comfortable day

This morning we did a bit more emailing, catching up on wrapping up the loose ends in Cape Town - a bit frustrating when the connection is so slow and you need to send a huge file. We then went into Nico's Shopping Centre where we found a better cyber caf&#xE9; with fast connection, did a quick shop at Shoprite for food and supplies (no beer as they are only sold in bottles! Will have to buy at campsite) We rode for the better part of the day on smooth tarmac road. From Lilongwe, we went up on the M1 to Kasungu where we then turned west towards Nkhotakota, and passed through Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve - dirt roads and increasingly gorgeous views around each bend. Once we reached the M5, we turned north and headed towards the Chintheche Strip of beach camps and lodges. Friends Maria and Paul from Cape Town gave us a copy of the Kite Runner on cd, read by the author. It's a gripping tale about an Afghani boy and it's kept us occupied for a big chunk of our journey so far. We might have to stock up on more books-on-tape somewhere later for the long desert stretches. We arrived in the dark at Kande Beach campsite. It was a longer day than we had hoped but we planned to stay for a day of much needed R&#x26;R tomorrow. Tonight we decided to dine at Kande's Soft Sand Caf&#xE9;. While Matt had the beef achaar (a local beef and gravy dish), I sampled their hearty pumpkin (in season right now) soup and homemade rolls. We shared a peach cheesecake afterwards but by far, our homemade cheesecake wins hands down (right Gailyn and Craig? harhar) Start: Lilongwe, MAL. 13:30 End: Kande Beach, MAL. 19:20 Total Distance: 384 km Road Conditions: no complaints Temperature: pleasant

When my eyes opened at 5:30 this morning, I couldn't go back to sleep. The sound of the crashing waves were too enticing, so I got up, boiled some water for my coffee and along with my coffee flask, took my book and laptop just a few paces from where we camped to the beach. Here I am, sitting first row centre on Kande Beach watching the sun peek through the thick clouds, strong wind blowing and not a soul in sight, unless you count the resident camp dog. What is it with us and attracting the camp animals? There hasn't been one place where we haven't stayed in for the past week where the resident dog or cat hasn't come to sniff us out. The wind is still rather strong so I'm not sure if kayaking is such a good idea. There's a rumour that the Liverpool vs. Birmingham match will be showed on tv at the bar later today too. -------------- Well, no kayaking today (too choppy) but we did go swimming, painted a few more pretty pictures on Foxy, fixed some minor things (water tank, gear stick, etc), had our bedding washed by local women from the village (yay for clean sheets!) and had a slow-cooking goat's shoulder braai for dinner. Another great day.

We woke up to a fairly intense rainfall (our first since the start of our journey) which soaked all of the clothes hanging on our line that we had just washed the previous day. Once the rain subsided and the sun peeked through, I took them over to the beach and slung them over the volleyball net in hopes it would dry before we had to leave. After a refreshing yoga stretch and last swim in Lake Malawi for me, we packed up Foxy and headed out. After arriving at night a couple of days ago, we promised we would always look over tomorrow's schedule and set a time to leave for the next day so we wouldn't have to drive in the dark again (too dangerous with no street lights, speeding trucks and random people and animals strolling on the road). We aimed to leave at 9am this morning, and pretty much on schedule, we left Kande Beach 18 minutes past 9 - this time in daylight, making it much easier to navigate the narrow paths and passageways back to the main road. Even so, we made one wrong turn and had to do a U-turn to take the other path. Kande village appears to be comprised of 99% children, and they ALL came to scream, holler, shout and wave to us and Foxy as we drove by. Malawi is a gorgeous country. I had not expected it would be this beautiful. Stopping in Mzuzu to refuel and pick up some bread, cheese and meat for lunch at People's Supermarket, we continued on the M1 towards Chitimba where we turned up onto the dirt 4x4 track towards Livingstonia. At that junction were two German girls looking for a lift up to Livingstonia. We moved some of our bags and boxes around, rearranged the washing that was hanging in the back drying, and they lay across our suitcase for the bumpy ride up. While we were fussing around, someone stole the brass padlock from Foxy's backdoor. We realized this when we were closing her up and immediately asked one of the many kids who had gathered around us who had taken it. If one of them had indeed taken it, no one admitted it. I had a hunch it was perhaps one of the other random people walking by while we were too busy to notice. This was the first thing that has been stolen on our trip and it makes me more disappointed than anything. This also serves as a little warning for us to be a bit more cautious while we are distracted in big crowds. Hmm. Anyway, off we went, up up the hill, 15 km of crazy hairpin bends and sheer drops. It took a while, but we made it! When we got to the famous Stone House in Livingstonia at the top, we could see poor old Foxy panting. It was the first time we had taken her up on such a track, but she did it - and rather admirably as well. After dropping the girls off and taking a quick peek in the museum, we decided to head back down the mountain and stay at Lukwe Eco-lodge which we passed on our way up. Cobwebs are abundant here at Lukwe Eco Lodge. With a continuously stoked boiler to heat hot water for showers and a very tidy and very smell-free compost toilet, it is a little slice of heaven here in Livingstonia. The view is simply breathtaking, crickets and birds chirp around the clock, a lot of care and maintenance has gone into making the pathways and gardens immaculate and there is a sense of peace and tranquillity, even amongst the two staff looking after us, Godwin and Chiso. We were the only guests that night so we had superb personal service. Luckily we arrived at a good hour because the chicken we ordered for dinner would have to take about 3 hours to prepare. We had a shower in their outdoor bamboo-reed stalls (stunning views of the hills), set up our tent and looked over our Tanzania maps to see which route we wanted to take. Dinner was taken by lantern-light at the large dining table under the thatch roof. We had the delicious "Irish (boneless) Chicken Stew" for 2 and fresh home-baked rolls. It was pitch black by then and so our bodies naturally ached for sleep. After reading a bit we turned off the lamp. It was only 19:30, if you can believe that. Start: Kande Beach, MAL. 9:18 End: Livingstonia, MAL. 15:00 Total Distance: 272 km Road Conditions: good smooth road with the occasional crater-like pothole. Road from M1 up to Livingstonia is a 15 km stretch of crazy hair-pin bends with the road carved right on the side of the mountain, just enough for one car inch its way up or down. Well worth the trip though. Temperature: chilly night with slight breeze

It was a long day's drive today. Just as we joined up with the main highway M1 after coming down from Livingstonia (another hair-raising ride full of sheer drops from cliff sides and S and U-shaped turns which required some reverse hill starts at the worst ones), there were about 15 young men who were clustered around this enormous tree that had obviously fallen recently. The tree lay on the side of the road and partly on the road itself. Long before we got to this "roadblock" we could see the boys pulling the biggest branches onto the road to block it some more, forcing motorists to stop. One of the boys came right up to Matt's window, the rest of them huddled around Foxy, ready to pounce. It was all a bit freaky as they each had huge axes in hand. I couldn't bring myself to take a picture, even though i desperately wanted to. The boy came straight out and asked for a "toll fee". We gave him 3 Malawian Kwacha which, when he announced the amount to the rest of the group, resulted in big whoops and cheers. We couldn't understand why. 3 Malawian Kwacha is about 2 US cents! We arrived at the Malawi/Tanzania border at 10am, our intended time. Procedures were pretty smooth again, there was just a bit of a wait while someone had to find the customs official to stamp our carnet. After getting our passport and visas sorted ($50 US for single entry), I was told to go to the back of the office in a private (air-conditioned) room to pay the car fee of $25 US. Behind the glass wall was a tall, broad woman in a beautiful dress. It was the first time I've seen a woman in such a "position of power" since leaving SA, and I was quite impressed. She immediately came out and asked "Are you from Burma?" when she saw me, which totally took me aback. I have never heard of many Burmese tourists getting to this part of Tanzania. When I told her "No, I'm of Chinese origin", she launched into a bit of Chinese goobly-gook that she knew, which was basically a whole lot of nonsense. We had a good laugh. I paid the money and she took my hand and bid us farewell. There is a lot more evidence of life this side of the border. It seems the farther north we go, the more populated the regions become. Fields upon fields of sunflowers grow here as well (we saw a lot of these in Zambia), a delicious sight. We passed tea plantations where women with huge women baskets on their backs were picking tea leaves. Incredible sight: dark green foliage punctuated with the colourful headscarves and wraps of these hardworking women. Like a flat Christmas tree decorated with bright lights and tinsel. This morning the clouds looked like puffy cotton balls, ready to explode and let loose a waterfall of wetness. Luckily we were out of the danger zone by noontime and didn't feel a drop. Climbing up and down the Potoro mountains rewarded us with some spectacular views. So many shades of green. Did you ever know there were so many? The Eskimos have dozens of names for the word "snow"; I wonder if it's true in Swahili. As we zoomed down these relatively smooth roads, there were some scary moments of over-taking and passing pedestrians carrying mounds of coal, firewood, fruit, etc, on their head/bicycle, wagon. The sign "Speed thrills but it also kills" we saw in Malawi flashed in my mind several times today; it seems Tanzania could do with a few of those billboards as well. There are also a surprising number of police road blocks here in Tanzania. We even spotted our first speed camera since leaving SA! But like everywhere else, so far we've just been waved on after a quick chat about where we are going and where we're coming from. "Jambo!" is used as a friendly greeting to tourists, who are usually assumed to not know any Swahili and so denotes "Hello, how are you, please continue speaking to me in English." "Hujambo!" is used to mean "Hello, how are you, I'm willing to speak a little Swahili with you." But be careful, once you use "Hujambo", people will normally engage rapid-fire- Swahili-mode. We did at one of many police blocks. We told him we had literally just crossed into Tanzania and it would take us a few days to get used to a few more phrases. Luckily he was kind and let us through, but not without telling us "you must learn Swahili". People-watching is fantastic here. Older men wear full suits and ties with matching shiny black shoes. They look incredibly elegant and poised, walking stick in hand. The women, I've remarked, are a lot taller, broader, fatter, prouder. More often than not, they are carrying a baby on the back, wrapped up tightly in a sarong. Most of them are walking with baskets of food or fuel for the night's supper. Men are usually clustered around bicycle or automobile shops, probably discussing how to fix this or that, and for what price. Children are left to play on their own, no adults or child-minder necessary. They make up games, chase each other and are allowed to run free. Most of them always wave as we zoom by. Adolescents are normally clumped in gender groups. Girls stroll down the streets, elbows locked, engrossed in what I presume must be the latest gossip. Like women, men tend to gravitate towards other men in small groups, watching, observing, lurking at whatever passes by. Some smile, some smirk, others just stare. A few can be seen alone with a girl, usually taking her on the back of his bike or teasing her in that playful/teasing kind of way that men all over the world do. Girls do too, I admit. And everywhere we go, there are children, teenagers, adults and elderly people on bicycles. It seems everyone has a destination, including us. We arrived at the beautiful Kisolanza Farm, just 50 km south of Iringa. Check out their website: http://www.kisolanza.com/ This is yet another shining example of what long-term sustainable development can do for a community and its citizens. The Ghaui family have been running the farm for years (the 4th generation was just born today!) With a secluded camping site (perfect for my yoga sunset stretch), there were hot showers and a clean long-drop toilet. Dinner was the best we've had so far. We sat on low chairs in a thatch hut and were served piping hot carrot and cardamom soup for a starter, followed by pasta, meatballs and cheese and fresh vegetables and herbs from the farm. Yum. Before going to bed, we placed our breakfast order for tomorrow morning. Bran flakes can wait another day. Start: Livingstonia, MAL. 07:26 End: Kisolanza Farm, 50 km south of Iringa, TAN. 17:00 Total Distance: 541 km Road Conditions: fair, but lots of heavy traffic on road (buses, trucks, bikes, pedestrians, animals)and plenty of police road blocks Temperature: bit humid down on the plains, nice in the mountains

This morning we dined in Kisolanzo's beautiful garden. Stella, a local villager who was training on the job, served us delicious eggs (omelette and poached), sausage and fried tomatoes. Along with a basket of freshly baked bread and locally produced orange marmalade from a women's group, we also had brewed coffee, yogurt and watermelon. We couldn't believe what a treat it was to have landed in a little piece of delectable paradise! It was sprinkling with rain all morning and our wipers seemed to have stopped working for some reason, so off we went to Iringa town to hit an ATM, an internet caf&#xE9;, post office and now added to our list, a car workshop. In the end, it was the electrics that were malfunctioning. The wipers are fixed and we happily went on our merry way. After a stunning drive down the valley alongside the Ruaha River, we arrived at our destination about an hour and a half later. We pulled into Baobab Valley Campsite and were greeted by 4 tall Maasai men. Wrapped in their signature red cloth and wearing (what Matt later called) very feminine white plastic sandals, they smiled and welcomed us like long-lost friends. They got the water boiler going and we had nice hot showers, followed by a canned curry dinner which we inhaled as quickly as we could due to the enormous moth infestation that was gathering by our feet and food. We quickly retreated to the camp's bar, looking over our guidebooks and atlas, trying to figure out a way north of here on roads that passed interesting parts of the country but that was also within our timeframe. In the end, we decided to forego seeing Zanzibar (couldn't bear the thought of leaving Foxy overnight somewhere while we ferried across to the spice island) and the world-famous Ngorogoro Crater and Serengeti Park (ridiculous park and camping fees would set us back a lot). We figured since we had our own reliable vehicle, we should try some of the secondary routes, the roads less travelled. If ever we were to return to Tanzania, the well-trodden tourist hot spots would always be accessible. So finally, our plan was to try out the B127 dirt road which runs north through the Maasai Steppe from Mikumi town, perhaps stopping in a small village to camp and eventually winding our way north-east towards the Rwandan border. With what seemed like a do-able plan, we went to bed excited for tomorrow's off-road adventure, listening to the distant sounds of roosters, frogs, crickets and rumbling trucks on the highway. Start: Kisolanza Farm, Iringa, TAN. 09:50 End: Baobab Valley Camp, Ruaha Village, TAN. 18:00 Distance Traveled: 210 km Road Conditions: paved with the occasional crater-size pothole Temperature: hot and humid night, we quickly made a plan to head more inland to higher ground.

<!-- ENTRY BODY -->
Today was a muddy muddy day. We left Baobab Valley Camp in high spirits, reached Mikumi town soon after and turned off on the B127 in hopes of seeing some of the back roads of Tanzania. While we were letting some of the air out of Foxy's tires (for better off-road conditions), a man and his hired help passed us in his yellow truck, slowing down to ask us if everything was alright. We told him we were just fine and he carried on up the track. Little did we know we would be asking him the same question, him answering to a different tune altogether. Just a few kilometres into our track, the road became pure mud, squishy and wet. We had a few near misses and slid off the road a few times into the shallow ditch. Hoping it would get better, we carried on, but the mud soon became thicker and the ditches deeper. Up ahead we could see the same yellow truck stopped sideways, wheels spinning in the muddy ditch. His truck didn't have 4 wheel drive, so we offered to pull him out. Our first Foxy rescue, how exciting!! We broke open our brand new rope and attached one end of it to the back of truck and after a gentle Foxy tug, he was back on the main road. He thanked us profusely, "May God be with you always." He had had enough and was going to head back home back down the hill. We had heard this part of the country was experiencing extended rainfall (Dar es Salaam was completely flooded apparently, as was Zanzibar) so we weren't surprised the tracks were so muddy. We continued on this muddy track for several more metres, but as we were literally just inching ahead, continuing on like this for several hundred more kilometres seemed plain silly. We decided not to risk it and after a slippery 3-point turn, we returned back to rejoin the perfectly good tar road which we knew would be passable. We looked at our map and considered going back to Iringa tonight and trying the A104 highway to Dodoma tomorrow, and then linking up with the B129 towards Rwanda. It meant backtracking again but there was no way we would make it through this road, unless we intended to do it over a course of several days. And there was of course the worry of not being able to get help if we needed it since we were only a single vehicle (without a winch or a satellite phone). So back we went, eventually choosing to camp at the Riverside Campsite just 12 km outside Iringa town. We arrived in good time to do a load of laundry, shower and relax for a while. We opted to eat dinner in their dining room, along with the other guests. Another treat awaited us: a large Indian buffet was being served, and then chocolate brownie for dessert (with nuts, unfortunately for me). Riverside Campsite offers Swahili lessons to tourists, families, or anyone who wants to learn the tongue. Staying there were several missionary families who had moved out to Tanzania to do some Bible translation and were partaking in an intensive language-training course. During dinner we gained some insightful information on the roads we were hoping to take tomorrow. We soon realized the extended rain that was plaguing this region was just too unpredictable and everyone thought we should just stick to the main tar road, just to be safe. So it looked like we would be backtracking again towards Mikumi and heading north that way. We decided that since we couldn't do our original plan, perhaps it was best to go and see the famous Serengeti National Park and Ngorogoro Crater. It would cost a small fortune, but when would we be back in Tanzania again? The whole evening felt a bit surreal: yesterday we were sitting and chatting with 4 Maasai men at a deserted campsite along the Ruaha River surrounded by enormous baobab trees. Tonight we are surrounded by families and young children and a handful of babies, feasting on scrumptious Indian food and watching BBC News! The semi-final match of the Champions League was being played tonight between Liverpool and Chelsea at 21:45 local time. Although it was quite late, we were desperate to see the match and asked anyone and everyone who was interested in going into Iringa town (12 km away) to watch the game. One guy, a Norwegian here on a 16-week Swahili course with his wife and 16-month old son, was also a die-hard Liverpool fan. He said we could all go in his Landy if we would drive. It was the perfect solution since we didn't want to pack up Foxy's tent, only to set it up again a few hours later. Matt promised the guy that he never did the drinking and driving thing, and that he was a safe driver and would be extra cautious tonight. The game was good, the result was not. Liverpool lost 3-2. Due to the match going into extended time, we didn't get back to Riverside Campsite until close to 1am, but it had been worth it, even if Matt had to drink Coca-cola. Start: Baobab Valley Camp, Ruaha Village, TAN. 8:30 End: Riverside Campsite, Iringa, TAN. (again!) 15:00 Distance Traveled: 241 km Road Conditions: mud + steep hills = impassable road Temperature: bit drizzly but comfortable

It was back on the Iringa - Mikumi highway again for us this morning. As beautiful a drive as it was, we were itching to cover some new territory. After a very horrible lunch at the TanSwiss Restaurant in Mikumi (it took nearly an hour for our deep-fried "mixed meat platter" and "chicken and mushroom sauce" to arrive), we drove through Mikumi National Park where the main highway runs right through it. We spotted some elephants, giraffes, water buffalo, zebras, and lots of baboons. We headed towards Morogoro town, where the Harvey family (whom we had met last night at Riverside Campsite) kindly offered their home for us to stay in, even if they weren't' there. When we arrived, Robert welcomed us into the Harvey home. Normally Robert home-schools the Harvey kids but for this week he was house-sitting while they were on holiday. An interesting chatty fellow with family connections spread all throughout the world, he told us we could stay in one of the kid's rooms. It was the first time we hadn't slept in Foxy's tent but actually it worked out for the best since it rained all night and we would've had an unpleasant time packing up a wet tent in the morning. We went to the nearby Morogoro hotel for dinner. Here in Tanzania, the food is fantastic, with always the choice of "local" food, Indian or Chinese. I'm loving it ALL. I'm becoming addicted to the chai (tea) as well, so sweet and smooth. Start: Riverside Campsite, Iringa, TAN. 11:00 End: Harvey Home, Morogoro, TAN. 17:45 Distance Traveled: 348 km Road Conditions: potholes and twisty-curvy roads looking a bit too familiar. Deja vu much?! Great roads after Mikumi National Park, but still lots of humongous speed bumps when passing through villages. Temperature: beautiful sunny morning, bit of drizzle throughout the day, bit humid at night.

After a good night's rest in a comfortable bed, we thanked Robert and left the Harvey Home to find an open supermarket to buy some supplies. In Tanzania, time is calculated in Swahili time. Sunrise (which is always at 6am) is 12 o'clock and so when someone tells you to meet him at 3:30, he actually means 9:30am. Here the shops opened at 2:30 so we were too early. Instead we ate egg and chicken sandwiches at a local fast food joint, got some more cash out at the ATM and went on our way, hoping to pick up supplies en route. After passing through Korogwe town, there was visibly less traffic which also meant less speeding buses careening down the other lane at insane speeds. We stopped for lunch (leftovers from last night's Indian meal) on the side of the road by some maize fields. While we ate and Foxy rested, a man on a bicycle passed us at a leisurely pace, singing out loud to no one in particular. Who needs a radio or MP3 player when you can carry your own tune? Seeing as it was still early in the day, we decided to carry onwards to Moshi, a bustling town at the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro, home to the Chagga people and one of Tanzania's major coffee-growing regions. Just as we turned west onto the A23 highway towards Moshi, there was a police roadblock. One of the police officer (all of them are dressed in starch-white uniforms, so bright it's almost blinding) swaggered over with his speed camera, which looks deceptively like a hair-drier, and showed us immediately that we had been speeding. There was no fussing around, he asked that we pay the 20,000 Shillings fine, told us we would get an official receipt and we could be off again. There was a slightly exaggerated pause after that, which we later wondered whether or not he was waiting for us to offer him a bribe in exchange of letting us go. But there was no way, with such strong sense of justice in both of us, that we would pay a bribe in any form, even if it was one tenth the price of the speeding ticket. With all the formalities completed, we were off again. Arriving just outside Moshi town, and after a very unnecessary detour through narrow alleyways in some farmer's field, we arrived at the Honey Badger Campsite. Initiated a couple of decades ago, it is now an educational centre, a cultural centre, a campsite and lodge, as well as a well-managed restaurant. Another local success story! That night we were given a sticker of the Honey Badger Campsite which we proudly put on Foxy's front passenger door. Check out www.hbc-campsites.com for more details. We had hoped to see Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa at 5896m, this evening but even after our shower and evening meal, the clouds were too thick and low and you couldn't even tell where the mountain stood. I'm told by the friendly guys working here that mornings are better for viewing Kili, as it is adoringly called. Dinner was a scrumptious buffet spread of rice, potatoes, ugali, vegetables, stew, chicken and beef (made especially for us). Joining us were other guests staying at the Honey Badger, one being a Congolese doctor, Dr. Lobo, who was here helping with Bible translation. As the conversation carried throughout the night, we found out that Dr. Lobo knew Dr. Joe Lusi (Lynn's husband), who we were going to meet in a week's time or so in Goma, DRC! The heavy clouds that threatened rain finally came and we went to sleep to the sound of water pummelling down on our tent and the incredibly loud barks of what sounded like a hundred dogs just in the next compound. Start: Harvey Home, Morogoro, TAN. 9:30 End: Honey Badger Lodge, Moshi, TAN. 17:30 Distance Traveled: est. 536 km (speedometer broke today and we didn't realize until too late. Either we get it repaired or I'll be judging distance travelled by GPS and/or maps.) Road Conditions: very nice, so nice in fact that it encourages the big long distance buses to speed outrageously. Temperature: rain in the morning, cloudy for the rest of the day, rain at night.

We woke up to heavy fog and cloud, and with that, our tiny hope of viewing Kili vanished. Oh well, postcards will have to do. We showered knowing that we wouldn't be able to for the next several days (we read that there is no running water at the public campsites in Ngorogoro and the Serengeti), and headed into Moshi town for breakfast. We stopped at The Coffee Shop, a cute little caf&#xE9; run by a local church which serves fresh Moshi coffee and tea, homemade breads and the clincher for me - chocolate cake, something I had been craving for for days. After stopping in Arusha to stock up on supplies at the local Shoprite and to fill up on gas, we drove west towards Ngorogoro Park, passing little villages separated by endless fields of maize and coffee. To enter the Ngorogoro Conservation Area, a World Heritage Site, the daily costs are hefty: $50 Park fee per person, $40 per vehicle, and $30 per person for camping. And if you want to go down into the crater, it's an additional $200! And of course most people do go down the crater. Who wouldn't? When you've come all the way out here, paid the necessary fees, it would be criminal not to see the lake and game life down below. Due to the 24 hour permit regulation, you have to be very careful when you enter the Park, making sure you leave enough time to see the sights and exit the Park before it expires. We entered Ngorogoro's gates at 16:30 which was perfect, enough time to marvel at the crater from the outer rim and to reach our designated public campsite before dark. For those visitors continuing onwards to the Serengeti (like we were planning on doing), timing is even more crucial as Ngorogoro and Serengeti share a border, so once you leave one Park, your next 24 hour Park permit starts ticking down. Although our guidebook mentioned Simba A public campsite to be "dirty, noisy, crowded and cold", we found it to be quite pleasant. We were travelling during the low-season, but there were several other independent travellers and a small group of overlanders as well. There were no showers to speak of (like we had anticipated) and it was extremely cold and windy, but the setting couldn't be more stunning, with a grassy hill and a magnificent view of the crater below. We had no charcoal left to barbeque our steaks, so while Matt went in search of some firewood, I went to ask the overlander's cook to see if we could buy some charcoal from him. At first he apologized and said he needed it for his guests tomorrow, but then he had a change of heart and came hollering to me, saying he could sell me the rest of the bag for 3000 Shillings, enough to send his driver to the next campsite and buy some more. So thanks to the kindness of a stranger (and there's a lot of it here), in the end we had a lovely charcoal steak dinner. But while the steaks were sizzling on the grill, we heard a loud low grumble from the nearby bush. Neither of us said it but it most definitely sounded like a lion's roar. The wind was picking up again and blowing towards the bush, no doubt taking the scent of meat (and us) with it. We packed up quickly, and when the steak was done cooking, hurried into the little covered hut to join the others and eat our dinner in relative safety. Later that evening, the rangers came around, asking to see everyone's permit. He remarked that we were not allowed to have campfires in non-designated sites as it was too dangerous. Yes Sir, we wouldn't do it again. Start: Honey Badger Lodge, Moshi, TAN. 10:40 End: Ngorogoro Simba A Campsite, TAN. 17:30 Distance Traveled: 261 km Road Conditions: some tar, some off-road, plenty of potholes Temperature: fresh during day, and very cold and very windy at night.

The alarm woke us up at 5am and in the dark and cold, we got ready and sped to the crater gate for its 7am opening. There was thick fog and we could barely see a few metres ahead of us but as the morning sun rose, the fog lifted and the incredible Lake Magadi unfolded before our eyes. With a maximum driving speed of 50 kph, we spent the morning exploring the Lake's edge, passing Mandusi Swamp, Ngoitokitok Dam, Seneto Springs and Lerai Forest. Although we saw quite a lot of game, namely elephants, hyenas, zebras, buffaloes, giraffes, wildebeest, warthogs, baboons, monkeys, and the most impressive flock of pink flamingos I've ever witnessed, it was the crater itself that was the highlight. With an area which covers 8292 sq. km, Ngorogoro Crater (www.ngorogoro-crater-africa.org) was first established in 1959 and is one of East Africa's most visited destinations. Local Maasai have grazing rights here and we came across some herds of cattle led by the beautifully cloaked Maasai herdsmen in their red and black cloth, sometimes carrying their signature spear and shield. With the Maasai warriors being one of the better-known "African tribes" in the world, many of them have taken to selling souvenirs to tourists at the crater's edge. Many also ask for money if you take their picture, knowing full well that people would pay a lot for 'the perfect shot.' I was asked to hand over 10,000 Shillings after snapping a quick one out of the car (I had asked for his permission first) but knowing this was a deliberate rip-off, I gave him a 2,000 Shillings note. He didn't seem to mind and I made a mental note of settling a price before I press the button from now on. Keeping in mind of our 24 hour permit, we took the 4x4 ascent trail back up to the crater's edge around noon and carried on towards Oldupai Gorge. There, we toured the basic, but very informative, museum and heard a short presentation by one of the staff members. The name "Olduvai" is derived from the Maasai world "Oldupai" which refers to the most common plant in the area: Mother-in-law's Tongue (aka sisal). One German visitor mistook the P for a V in "Oldupai" and so efforts are being made today to revert back to the original name. It is quite a feeling to be standing in "the cradle of humankind" and to imagine what it was like millions of years ago when layers of volcanic ash were deposited here to form what is now known as the Ngorogoro Highlands. The world-famous Leakey couple (Louis and Mary) spent most of their lives excavating fossil remains of early life here during the 1950's-1970's, and the work continues today by archaeologists. We made it out of Ngorogoro Park by our 16:30 deadline and crossed into the Serengeti National Park. Again, the park fees were steep: $50 per person/day, $40 for a vehicle, and $30 per person to camp at the public campsite. At least there was no crater fee this time. Seeing as it was the perfect time for an evening game drive, we went towards the Simba Kopjies area before heading towards Seronera and our camp. Within 20 minutes of entering the Park, we spotted 3 lions lying lazily on these impressive rocks. As Tanzania's largest National Park, the Serengeti covers 14,763 sq km of complete wilderness. When you mention Africa to most people, images of the Serengeti Plains usually pop to mind, and it is just like what you see on TV or in books, perhaps even more beautiful: fields of grass and shrubs and trees, stretching far into the distance. Elephants gathered at the watering hole, zebras nuzzling one another, giraffes and gazelles grazing in herds, all looking healthy and majestic. The sunset was, of course, magnificent. We arrived at Dikdik Public Campsite just in time to put up our tent and cook our dinner. There was a safari group already there, a couple of Korean guys and a British overseas volunteer and her friend. They had joined a local tour to visit Ngorogoro and Serengeti over a period of 4 days. As we introduced ourselves and chatted, a family of giraffes were grazing a few metres away near the ablution blocks. Surreal! With no fence around the campsite, we knew better this time than to start an open campfire and cook some meat. Instead, the group's cook had just finished preparing their dinner and so kindly let Matt use his hot coals to barbeque our meat while I made some instant noodles and pea soup for our second course. It was much warmer tonight and we opened all of our tent windows in hopes of catching an elephant or giraffe wandering through the campsite. With no way to shower, we brushed our teeth and dozed off to the sound of hungry hippos (which made me think that's how the children's board game got its name) munching and grunting away, blissfully unaware, or at least indifferent to us being so close by. Start: Ngorogoro Simba A Campsite, TAN. 06:48 End: Serengeti Dikdik Campsite, TAN. 18:45 Distance Traveled: 270 km Road Conditions: steep 4x4 track into/out of crater, nothing Foxy couldn't handle though. Temperature: cold and foggy morning, warming up only in mid-afternoon, warm evening in Serengeti

After getting up at a more reasonable hour (6am) we ate breakfast while marvelling at the Serengeti sunrise, packed up Foxy, bid the others farewell and went down to Makoma Hills (where the guards yesterday told me we would find the famous migration.) He was right. After driving for only about a half hour, we saw hundreds of thousands of zebras migrating north. They are such splendid animals, so graceful and elegant, travelling in single file more or less, a solid line of black and white stretching far into the distance. Wanting to follow this migration by the river, we made our way north, going through some pretty rough terrain, huge muddy ruts and horrible corrugated gravel. Many people commented in the guest book at the Park entrance about the outrageous fees and the horrible road conditions, not to mention the fact that facilities at the public camp site are next to none. One would think with the price we're paying, some maintenance work would be done. Apparently there are only 6 rangers to cover the all of the 36 campsites! But I suppose it is the Serengeti, and if anything, the name of the Park draws consistent visitors from around the globe. We're no exception. After seeing the zebra migration, a rare sighting we're told, we came across another clump of kopjies with a couple of safari jeeps stationed at the base. It's always a good sign if there are stopped vehicles, it means that there is something interesting happening right then. And there was! A pride of lions (we counted 7 at one point, including a tiny cub) were lingering around the rocks, lying, sleeping, yawning and what was more incredible, absolutely devouring a wildebeest carcass. Although we had missed the actual hunt 'n kill, watching them attack their breakfast with such passion and viciousness was unforgettable. We were literally not more than 10 metres away, probably the closest you could get at a safe range. We sat there for more than an hour as each lion had their share of the meat. There is a highly respected pecking order and while one would eat, the others would wait nearby, no doubt salivating. For the rest of the day, we saw plenty of giraffes, wildebeest, gazelles, elephants (and super tiny baby ones as well, probably a few weeks old only), baboons, monkeys, hippos, crested cranes, ostriches, and a few more lions. Our quest for spotting a leopard was coming to a disappointing end and we had to move west towards the Ndabaka Gate before our permit expired at 15:39. The Western Corridor stretch of the Serengeti was quite dull (in terms of game viewing), just as our guidebook suggested. We took a few side roads, one going through the Kyabatero Hills, hoping to spot the elusive leopard. Bad move. Instead we got maliciously attacked by swarms of tsetse flies. It happened so fast that by the time we rolled up our windows and closed Foxy's vents, dozens of them had already entered. I have never encountered a tsetse fly before and I would not wish it upon anybody. In Canada, I've had my share of getting bitten by horse-flies and blackflies, but tsetses are simply the worst of its kind. They are quite cunning: they don't make a buzzing sound so you don't know when they're around, they hover and wait until you've forgotten about them and then land on you without so much as a tickle, and by the time they've bitten, it's too late. You're squirming and squealing and in excruciating pain. For the remainder of our Serengeti safari, we had the windows rolled up, the vents closed, and as Matt was negotiating the rough tracks, I was looking everywhere but outside for any tsetse flies that needed a good whacking with my guidebook. Usually I'm quite a humane kind of person when it comes to unwanted insects and bugs. I normally catch them and release them outside. But there was no chance of that today. With every kill, Matt would cheer loudly, even if it meant whacking him as hard as I could if one landed on him. Afterwards, I read in our LP, that tsetse flies cause Trypanosomiasis (aka. Sleeping sickness) and "causes headache, fever and eventually coma." We will be looking out for each other over the next few days to see if any symptoms creep up. Hmm Without a breath of wind in the air to begin with, it started to get quite stuffy in Foxy. Luckily the fans worked and we had some hot air blowing out of the vents while we drove on. Images of us driving in Sudan and Egypt's stifling heat danced in our minds and we both agreed it was time to seriously consider putting in an air-conditioner, maybe in Mwanza or Kampala. Needless to say, we were happy to see the Park gate a couple of hours later. Now we can say we didn't get chased by lions or leopards or cheetahs in the Serengeti; we got chased out by tsetse flies instead. But the day had more excitement in store for us. As soon as we pulled up to the Ndabaka Gate to get a cold drink and use the toilet and pump up Foxy's tires again to normal road pressure, the car wouldn't turn off. The lights wouldn't turn off either and in the end, Matt had to stall it in order for it to actually shut off. We had planned a R&#x26;R day in Mwanza tomorrow but now it looks like we'll have to take Foxy into a garage to be fixed. There was nothing we could do except carry onto Mwanza and find the Mwanza Yacht Club, apparently "the best place to camp beside Lake Victoria" according to one of our guidebooks. Once we arrived, and it was indeed a gorgeous setting overlooking Lake Victoria with grass and open space, we realized that they didn't have hot water for showers and the internet connection we had been hoping for didn't exist. And it was 10,000 Shillings per person to camp! There was no question we needed a good shower to scrub off the past three days' dirt and grime. Disheartened, we fired Foxy up again and left in search of another campsite. Matt had spotted a little sign from the road earlier advertising a campsite by the water as we whizzed towards the Yacht Club, but because he couldn't remember exactly where he saw this sign, we retraced our route all the way out of Mwanza again. In the meantime, we spotted another sign which promised "resort-style lodging and camping" so we went to investigate that option. Turns out, it was in the middle of a crowded lane with no chance of camping. So back we went towards the Yacht Club, thinking we would have to stay at a hotel for the night, when we spotted the Peace of Mind Lodge sign. I noted their numbers down and off we went in search of this promised haven near Bwiru Beach. After numerous scratchy phone connections and a maze of wrong turns, we arrived exhausted, filthy, famished but overall, relieved. From now on, we have decided that whenever we have finished something as energy-consuming such as the past few days (ie. not having washed for 3 days, coated in dirt, mud, dust, sunscreen, and then another layer of dirt, mud and dust; being attacked by vicious tsetse flies; finding out our car won't turn off; and when we think we've arrived at last, hearing that there's no hot water for showers, where then you have to spend more energy searching and navigating a new town for a campsite; getting lost and turned back at random alleyways meant only for pedestrians), we will simply call it a "Mwanza Moment." But in life, most good things are earned through hard work and a lot of sweat, and this was certainly no exception. The entire staff of Peace of Mind Lodge were waiting for our arrival and as soon as we pulled in, began pampering us as if we were expected royalty! Beer and popcorn were brought to us immediately, and a tent was set up by 4 workers for us in the perfectly manicured garden. Curious about all the Chinese paper lanterns and d&#xE9;cor at Peace of Mind Lodge (there was even Chinese writing on the key chains!), we inquired about the owners. Apparently it used to be owned by a Chinese family but had just been bought 5 months ago by a local Tanzanian man. We had probably the best shower of our life (with HOT WATER!) and then settled down to eat at the lodge's adjoining restaurant. One of Celine Dion's album was being played on repeat, which after a while, did the skipping thing (why no one stopped it we don't know), the TV remote was placed on our table so we could change the channel, and along with our own personal waiters, we had our very own cook as well! We could see from the registry that not only were we the only guests for the night, they hadn't had a guest for over 10 days! Hence the pampering I suppose. Being the only customers certainly had its advantages, but it also meant waiting for over an hour for our dinner to be cooked, and where our waiter, a Ugandan and so thrilled that Matt had lived there once, forgot about our starter. It didn't matter, the food eventually came and we were thankful. I had a sort of (chewy) chicken curry and steamed rice while Matt had a pepper steak and mashed plantains (a Ugandan staple). Our starter, a chef salad, came as we were standing up to leave. Sleep came fast and deep, but we were both woken up a few times during the night by the cries and shrieks of the neighbourhood dogs. There seems to be some sort of night-time ritual that dogs all over Tanzania perform which include loud incessant barking to each other from one end of the town to the other. Start: Serengeti Dikdik Campsite, TAN. 08:20 End: Peace of Mind Lodge, Mwanza, TAN. 18:20 Distance Traveled: 318 km Road Conditions: in Serengeti, some horrible corrugated dirt roads and deep ruts; after exiting Park, fairly smooth tarmac to Mwanza with the expected speed bumps and traffic. Temperature: hot, dry and not a breath of wind. Made worse by having to keep the windows rolled up so crazy tsetse flies wouldn't get in. Light rain at night.

Today we are spending the day in Mwanza, me catching up on blog entries and Matt going into town to fix Foxy. We had to turn off both car batteries so that the headlights would turn off. Luckily there is a Landrover garage listed in one of our guidebooks so we're hoping the problem will be fixed today. Like our new car sticker says, "No Hurry in Africa!" Indeed. The "mzungu" (literally means 'white man') calling is becoming more incessant as we enter bigger towns. But it's usually children who do it; adults just lock eyes with you and stare. I was never one for staring so I normally smile or wave, which usually invokes a grin or a thumbs-up sign. The staff here at Peace of Mind Lodge have been incredible hosts here. They said the internet connection was installed yesterday and when we tried to connect our laptop this morning and found out it didn't work, one of them called their server company immediately to have someone come out and fix the connection. What service! I feel so pampered here. Typing away on the laptop under the garden hut, surrounded by gorgeous green aloe plants, newly-washed clothes hanging on the line, sun high and bright with steady breeze coming from Lake Victoria, tummy full of chicken sandwich, salad and chai. ---------- Well, the woman from the internet company came to sort out the connection. It turns out the Lodge was never connected because they hadn't paid yet. Oops. We'll have to go into an internet caf&#xE9; tomorrow instead. And it looks like Foxy is getting a big tune-up and won't be ready until tomorrow afternoon. The Landrover garage owner is also trying to locate a used air-conditioner for Foxy. We're keeping our fingers crossed. So we'll probably spend a couple more nights here in Mwanza which is fine by us. We are exceptionally tired and could do with a bit of rest and relaxation. Don't think it's the sleeping sickness symptom kicking in; it's more likely to do with us being on the road for the past 4 weeks. Yes, exactly 4 weeks tomorrow! Wow. Start: - End: - Distance Traveled: 0 km Road Conditions: - Temperature: gorgeous morning, slight breeze all day and warm night

Spent another night at Peace of Mind Lodge, this time on fresh clean sheets - bliss! The only little annoyance was the persistent stream of ants trampling into our tent. Still, included in our camping fee here, we get breakfast and a pretty delicious one at that (see pic): Spanish omelette, toast, fresh fruit (papaya, orange, mango), fresh pineapple juice and coffee and chai. It's like those continental breakfast posters you see blown up all over China, those that are proudly displayed in a small tin hut in the middle of nowhere. Tanzania has surprised me in many ways. I had just ticked it off as a country we had to go through to reach London, but it has been the most fascinating so far, both in people and geography. The wildlife is no doubt exceptional, but from the conversations we've had with locals, expatriates, missionaries, and other tourists, there is a lot more than just what one sees on the surface. After a morning at Karibu Internet Caf&#xE9; (very trying as connection was intermittent, the lighting was dim inside and it was stifling hot), we decided to go for lunch at a pizzeria nearby. After absolutely stuffing ourselves silly, we went to withdraw money at a nearby ATM to pay the Landrover guy. It took us several attempts at a couple of ATM's but we managed to gather the necessary funds, then walked to the Landy garage in scorching heat. This morning they told us they had managed to gather all the parts necessary to install an air-conditioner in Foxy! It would take another day or so, but it will be done!! Cue cheers and thunderous applause. We are stoked. No more tsetse fly attacks! Yippee! The owner of the garage (an Indian guy who had just recently taken over from the previous German owner), was a happy-go-lucky kind of guy who had, out of pure rage yesterday, punched a car and broke his hand when his workers brought in the Labour Department Officer to demand higher wages for the staff. Today he was sporting a brand new white cast on his right hand, the poor man. ** http://www.africa-overland.net/Africa is an African Overland website where independent travellers' blogs are listed for everyone to see. We're now part of this site, check out our foxy Foxy on the main page! Start: - End: - Distance Traveled: 0 km Road Conditions: - Temperature: nice and comfortable in the shade while seated, but wicked hot during mid-day stroll around town. Fancy that.

Today was a day of rest. After breakfast, I went back to sleep. Just a short 3 hour nap. We have been so tired since arriving in Mwanza, just physically exhausted. Poor Matt had a bad day of self-inflicted injuries, perhaps due to his level of exhaustion: whacking his head on the bathroom door, falling through one of the open sewer cracks in the pavement and the last straw, getting stung by a bee on his hand during dinner. We've been to visit Foxy every day at the garage to see how she's improving. It felt almost like visiting a sick relative in hospital, I felt I should've brought flowers or something. We're told by tomorrow 10am she'll be ready to hit the road. We hope so! Tonight we had dinner at Yun Long restaurant, a huge Chinese place on the riverfront. We had the spicy Szechuan beef and tofu (something I always miss while travelling) and veg. Funnily enough, as good as the food was, the best bit was being able to use chopsticks again. It felt warmly familiar. Start: - End: - Distance Traveled: 0 km Road Conditions: - Temperature: nice

I really hope Foxy will be ready today. As comfortable and relaxed as it is in Mwanza, we are both ready to hit the road again. I am quite looking forward to visiting Rwanda, to meet its people (who I've read are some of the nicest and friendliest you could ever meet), and learn about its history. I wonder at times if it will come as a shock when we're in Nanaimo, BC, living somewhere relatively permanent - will I find it difficult to adapt to not being on the move everyday? Still, it's been very therapeutic being able to sleep in a bed (we caved last night and opted to sleep in one of their rooms; the tv and dvd machine was the deciding factor), not having to climb out and down of the tent to go to the toilet in the dark, to eat delicious food and connect with home again. We have been pouring over our maps and we figure one long day of driving could get us to Kigali in Rwanda (barring the border formalities are quick and painless). We have joined the online Couchsurfing forum where you create your own profile and depending on where you are, request to stay at another Couchsurfer's home for a night (or however long) while passing through their town. It's a system based on trusting complete strangers to come into your home, sleep on your couch/bed, and basically be a respectful guest. Although we haven't yet hosted a guest or even been a guest, the concept is fantastic. Not only do you get free accommodation, but also the invaluable knowledge of a local! Foxy will be ready at 10am, promised Mr. Suresh at the Landy garage. But it's already past 1pm and no sign of Foxy - or Matt. We were hoping to leave this afternoon and get a couple of hours on the road. The only problem is there aren't any campsites which we know of where we can camp safely. Perhaps it is best to stay one more night and start off early tomorrow. We'll see. No Hurry in Africa, right? --------------------- 20:00 Ok, it was a bit too hopeful, thinking we could leave this afternoon. Instead, after Matt returned to the Lodge with Foxy around 2pm, we had to bring her back to the garage an hour later to have the wipers fixed and other things tightened. A nice surprise was also waiting for me: Matt had the guys install a lock on the front passenger door so now instead of him having to always unlock my door from the inside, i can let myself in. Less hassle, and an added security feature. It was too late to start driving today so tomorrow we'll make an early start, catch the 7:30 ferry and head for Kigali in Rwanda in one straight go. So to pass another lazy afternoon, we went back to the Hotel Tilapia to use their wireless internet and devour their delicious curries and cakes. We also met another overland couple at Hotel Tilapia going the same route as us (up to Europe through the ME) and working around the same schedule (to be in Europe by early August). Christoph (photojournalist from Germany) and Chiho (graphic designer from Japan) were also on their way to Kigali tomorrow so we decided to travel together for a bit. It was fantastic to meet other overlanders, especially those our age, and we compared journeys, countries, experiences and of course, Landrovers. They began their trip over a year ago and had come all the way down from West Africa and were making their way back to Germany for their August 8th wedding. We told them about Peace of Mind Lodge and they decided they would stay there as well, which pleased the staff immensely to have more guests. Tonight we went all piled into Foxy (luckily Christoph and Chiho are small people) and we went into town to get some cash at an ATM, gas up, and find some food. We ended up eating at the Lake Hotel, more delicious curries and chapatis of course. I will certainly miss the food in Tanzania, there is no doubt about that. Back at the Lodge in our comfy room, we watched another installment of West Wing, a very fitting episode because it was loosely based around the Rwandan genocide and how the world did nothing but watch in silence as it was happening. Start: - End: - Distance Traveled: 0 km Road Conditions: - Temperature: heavy thunderstorm in the afternoon, literally a wall of water was blowing sideways into the hotel's restaurant. We all ducked for cover and the waitresses used the tablecloths as raincoats.

Our alarm went off at 5:15 and we both got up, ready and excited to be on the road again. Unfortunately, it seems ESKOM's wrath is still following us around as there was no power (it was still pitch dark out and we needed the lights). But upon hearing us rummaging for our head torches and packing our belongings, the Lodge owner fired up the generators which probably annoyed the neighbours to a considerable degree, seeing as it was Saturday morning. Oh well, we were off by 6:30, but not before asking the owner to sign Foxy. We thought since we had spent a considerable amount of time at his hotel, we should have a reminder of our time there somehow. Only later did we realize, much to our amusement, he signed it "Piece of Mind Camping Site" when in fact it should've been "Peace of Mind". Matt remarked later that it was rather appropriate since sometimes we did want to give them a piece of our mind when dinner took almost 2 hours to arrive. But overall, we were definitely treated like special VIP guests and we have made a note to list it on LP's Thorntree online site so they get more exposure, and hopefully, more customers. Mwanza ferry pier was already buzzing when the four of us arrived at 7:00. We parked both of our Landrovers behind the other 3 trucks that had arrived just before us. After the big passenger bus was loaded on the Nansio Ferry, the trucks went on, followed by a long stream of foot passengers. Christoph went up and asked if we couldn't try and get on as well. The next ferry was in one hour and as our day's drive was going to be long enough, we really wanted to get on this one. Luckily the guy let us try, although he was not so optimistic. Christoph drove their (nameless) Landy in first, parked it just inches away from the side. Matt then took Foxy up the ramp and managed to squeeze in between the two cars. And then MORE foot passengers came trudging up the ramp, turning sideways to get by Foxy. The ferry ride was a pleasant 30 minute journey to Kamanga. Once we disembarked, we drove on a road towards Geita that could barely pass for a "dirt track". Narrow lanes, giant potholes, rocky terrain, it was both a 4x4 driver's dream and a passenger's nightmare. Our washing certainly got a good tumble. After reaching paved road again it was pretty smooth right up to the Rwandan border. Crossing into our 6th country, we now knew the procedure: immigration first to get our exit stamp in our passport, then to customs to get our Carnet de Passage stamped and cleared. Then drive through no-man's-land to the next border post, get our entry stamp in our passport and if necessary, pay for our visa (and any other cost), and lastly get our Carnet de Passage stamped for entry. No visas are required for Canadians or British Nationals, so that made things even that much less painful. PLUS we gained one more hour because Rwandan time is one hour behind Tanzania's. Wonderful! Immediately, I noticed how kind and friendly the Rwandan officials were. It was also the first time I got to use my French on this trip which felt great. We noticed that one of the officers had several fingers missing from his right hand; our first encounter with a genocide victim? Already, being in Rwanda was going to be a completely different experience than either of us have ever known. One thing we had to get used to, and get used to quickly, was that we now had to drive on the right hand side of the road. This made overtaking a bit more difficult as the person driving Foxy sits on the right side. So on top of my role as 'navigator extraordinaire', before I would command "turn right at the next junction", now I had to add "and STAY RIGHT!!" The first thing we noticed upon crossing into Rwanda was how slim everyone was and there were just as many women officers as men, which impressed me immensely. The second thing that was pleasantly shocking was the gardens in front and around each and every house. It seems every family takes great pride in having a beautiful garden of fruits and flowers and vegetables. It is just after the rainy season so everything appears that much more green and alive. A couple of hours later we arrived at Milles Collines Hotel to meet our first Couchsurfing host, Vero. She arrived with her 2 year old adopted son, Gabriel, and then took us to her home nearby. She has been living in Rwanda for 12 years, working with the EU in the justice department. 10 years ago, she did the same overland journey we're doing, but in the other direction, and she gave us some good advice on the countries to come. After sweet Gabriel was put to bed, we spent a wonderful evening with her and another one of her friends/colleagues, Gian Pierot, also working here on assignment with the EU and helping out with the upcoming parliamentary election in September. We went out to an Italian restaurant and over some interesting conversation, had lovely pizza and pasta, and although stuffed, us two girls couldn't resist the tiramisu. Start: Peace of Mind Hotel, Mwanza, TAN. 06:40 End: Vero and Gaby's home, Kigali, RW. 18:15 Distance Traveled: 520 km Road Conditions: Kasanga to Geita was HORRIBLE dirt track, needed to zigzag through the crater-size ditches and humongous boulders. 15 km took us 87 minutes! Temperature: nice, then a bit of rain once we entered Rwanda. Evening quite chilly, but in that lovely mountain-air-crispness way.

This morning we woke up, marvelled at the beautiful garden and huge avocado tree, had a leisurely breakfast of fresh mangoes, cereal, toast and rich Rwandan coffee with Vero, Gabriel and Gian Pierot outside on the terrace, and then got ready to go to the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre. Traffic flows fairly smoothly in Kigali and a big part of that may be due to the fact that traffic regulations are actually followed here, therefore eliminating any congestion. Or maybe there are just more bicycles and motor-taxis and less private vehicles. Although traffic may be manageable, navigating Kigali's streets is another matter. With extremely steep hills (poor Foxy was moaning and groaning almost the whole time) and roundabouts that seem to merge into other roundabouts, it can be quite confusing to get to your destination, even if it is only a couple of kilometres away. We met Christoph and Chiho at the Genocide Memorial Centre, and while we only intended to be there for an hour or two, we stayed for nearly four. The Genocide Memorial Centre is a comprehensive, well-organized display of pictures, videos and posters of the Rwandan genocide in 1994. There are no words for what happened. It was simply horrendous. It is estimated that 800,000 Rwandans were violently killed in just three months. What makes this genocide so grotesque and disturbing is not just how systematic the killing was, done mainly by Interahamwe militias of gangs of youth, but that it was so violent, so cold-blooded, and so brutal. Many of the deaths were caused by machetes, spears, and other blunt objects, meant to torture and inflict as much pain and suffering as possible to the victims before they were left to die. The UNAMIR (UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda) was present during the genocide but was powerless to prevent any of the killings because of an ineffective mandate. There has been much criticism directed at the international community, who did virtually nothing. In the museum there are pictures of the victims, too many of them children; clothes that were found on bodies in mass burial pits; video testaments of survivors and how they have coped with the massacre; and in the memorial garden, lies the remains of 250,000+ victims. We were very impressed with the museum. It must have been quite a task to present the horrific event in a way that is true and honest, without needing to "shock and awe" with too many graphic pictures. The thousands of innocent (young) lives lost is enough to make anyone wonder why and how humans continue to cause such pain to each other after such an event. What was also quite impressive was that, upstairs in the museum, there were displays of other acts of genocide around the world, detailing the history and events leading up to it. Today, Rwanda has done an amazing job of getting life back on track. The government has been quite strict and many basic laws that people adhere to (perhaps out of fear?) are lacking in other African countries. For example, all the motor-taxi drivers wear a vest with an assigned registered number and you never see a driver or his passenger without a helmet. Once a month, all Rwandan residents (locals AND foreigners) go out on the streets and clean up their neighbourhood. No one is exempt. And if you are caught walking through public gardens or traffic islands (which are made of healthy-looking grass and pretty flowers), you get fined $300 US on the spot. It is quite a shock for us to see such order in a country; perhaps after such hell on earth, people yearn for some sort of order from a leader they respect. Or is it? People have told us that although things may appear all peaceful and organized on the surface, tensions are still brewing and it may be only time before something explodes again. Coincidentally, a good article was published on the online Guardian newspaper recently. Read: We Have to Kill Tutsis Wherever They Are. After a leisurely lunch with Chris and Chiho at the Milles Collines Hotel (the only place on a Sunday you can change American dollars), we went back to Vero's home and prepared dinner for all of us: a stir-fry concoction of fish, veg and rice. Start: - End: - Distance Traveled: 20 km Road Conditions: just around Kigali, a fairly small town with lots of steep hills and confusing roundabouts. Temperature: heavy thunderstorm in the afternoon, literally a wall of water

This morning in Kigali, I went to Rwanda Eco-Tours to confirm and pay for my gorilla trek (for Thursday). Matt had already done the gorilla trek twice when he was in Uganda, and so we decided that it wasn't worth the cost ($500 US pp! and going up to $1000 later this year!) for him to go again. Martha, the extremely friendly and helpful owner of Rwanda Eco-Tours, went out of her way to help us book camping accommodation for the night (which we unfortunately didn't end up going to due to time constraints) and to escort us to the bookstore several blocks away, where we stocked up on a lot of new magazines and books. Martha is an amazing hard-working woman and we were both so pleased to have met her, even briefly. Look her up if you're ever in Kigali! They also focus on community-geared tourism, where they take ex-poachers and have them skilled in something else so they don't need to go out and hunt, but instead do village tours for tourists or provide a night of entertainment and dinner for willing customers. After changing our Tanzanian shillings to Rwandan francs at a local Forex bureau, we had a delicious buffet lunch at the Karibu Cafe, all for 2200 francs ($4US) including drinks! We then headed towards Gisenyi, the border town north-west of Rwanda, where we intended to spend the night. Poor Foxy got a much more intense workout than she had bargained for, even if it was a relatively short driving day. The mountainous road which we took from Kigali to Gisenyi winds its way up and around dozens of hills and mountains. We chugged and chugged along, usually letting other vehicles pass us by. We noticed an odd rubber-burning smell which was more acute when we were nearing the top of a hill. We added it to our ever-growing list of "Things To Do At Some Point." The ride was fantastic; as soon as we got to the highest mountain pass, we were rewarded with clear views of the famous chain of the seven volcanoes, forming the natural border with the DRC and Uganda. It is in these mountains, the Parc National des Volcans where Dian Fossey spent years with the mountain gorillas and battled with poachers and government officials to preserve the creatures from extinction. As we passed a multitude of fields, villages and shops on the hillside, all so obviously well cared-for, the scenery increased in beauty and the air, in pureness. Rwanda is blessed with a temperate climate and very fertile soil, and from what I could tell, not one square inch was wasted. As we got closer to Gisenyi town, there were more people congregated on the road, and the houses and shops were built much closer to the road and to each other. There was, in general, a lot more activity. Still, the beautifully-manicured gardens were there, glorious flowers and healthy-looking vegetables. It seems both men and women share in the workload, in the gardens and in the fields. At one point, we passed a huge road construction site where people were hauling buckets of water and stones up the hill, while others were busy hacking away at the (what will be a new) road. And it was the men AND women doing this, working together side by side. This really surprised me, as most jobs I've noticed so far in Africa have been quite gender related. It is no wonder every Rwandan we've seen so far is fairly slim and healthy-looking; the daily dose of physical labour keeps them fit, as does going up and down all the steep hills - more often than not by foot. Once we turned the last bend and Lake Kivu was in sight, deluxe luxury hotels and lodges could be seen everywhere. What a contrast; a few kilometres earlier we had passed a refugee camp with about a dozen white dome tents given by UNHCR. Apparently Gisenyi "is a ritzy resort town for rich Rwandans and resident foreigners." It seems rather odd that just surrounding this little holiday paradise are rebel groups still fighting across the border, forcing displaced persons into makeshift homes. We arrived at Paradis Malahide, a beautiful little hideaway on the shores of Lake Kivu and we were happy to see that we could park Foxy behind their gates. We were promptly welcomed by a happy fellow who eagerly showed us around. We decided to opt for a room (with a stunning view) tonight as we will be asking the Hotel if we can keep Foxy overnight tomorrow when we go across to the DRC. We quickly got settled in and went for a dip in Lake Kivu, the world's 15th deepest lake at 480m, but not before asking about the gaseous eruptions which are reportedly still happening in certain parts of the lake. Just as we finished our swim (well, it was more like a quick wade-in-wade-out), shower and yoga (me), the lightning started giving the most awesome light show, quickly followed by deafening thunder (which Matt remarked sounded like volcanoes erupting) and heavy rain. We sat on the porch watching this amazing natural wonder, thankful we chose not to camp tonight, and then went to eat dinner at the Lodge's restaurant. And what a meal it was! Along with some tasty appetizers that were on the house, we ate fresh tilapia, chips, rice and goat stew, all beautifully presented in a fish-shaped platters. Sleep came fast and deep tonight, under our mosquito net, rain pounding on the roof outside. Start: Vero and Gaby's home, Kigali, RW. 12:45 End: Paradis Malahide, Gisenyi, RW. 16:46 Distance Traveled: 170 km Road Conditions: mostly tar but quite a lot of big potholes, and LOTS of curves and tight turns. Temperature: cloudy cool day and an amazing, almost scary, thunderstorm at night.

It has been the most incredible day. I'm having trouble sleeping, with the past 24 hours playing in my head over and over again. Goma is a special place, HEAL AFRICA specifically, full of special people doing very special things. But let me start from the beginning. Crossing the border this morning was as simple as simple can get. Matt had this whole speech rehearsed in his head, and was geared up to recite it to the customs official, at full volume. No bribe was going to change hands today. Nope, not from us. But there was absolutely no hassle, no harassment, no effort whatsoever to rip us off. Incroyable! I don't know why, but we were expecting the worst of the worst. Congo is the "heart of Africa" and its reputation of rampant corruption, and over-zealous, trigger-happy officials doesn't exist for just any old reason. I have to say I do feel a bit guilty for having had these notions now. The fact is, this particular border crossing (Gisenyi in Rwanda and Goma in DRC) is probably the one where the majority of aid workers, UN convoys and foreigners enter and exit from, it being the safest. Therefore, customs officials are used to issuing visas, stamping foreign passports and seeing Mzungu (white) faces. Once we filled out our immigration form, we were ushered into the office where we paid for our transit visa, which we were told was $35 pp (and not $75 like we had thought, so another bonus!), and because we had left Foxy at Paradis Malahide Hotel, there was no need to stamp our Carnet de Passage - so off we went, into the chaotic streets of Goma, each of us wearing a backpack and carrying a black ammo box full of medical supplies, which, due to some minor miracle, were never ever inspected or even questionned! HEAL AFRICA is roughly one kilometre away from the border post, so we decided to walk there. We tried to call Lyn on her mobile but there was no answer for some reason. At least a few dozen motor-taxis honked and asked if we wanted a ride, but each time we refused, thinking we were almost there. But gradually, the box i was carrying became heavier and heavier and i thought, "well, I look strange enough walking down the middle of town carrying black boxes sweating like a sick pig, so i might as well do it African-style", so on top of my head the box went. And suddenly, it felt light as a feather. Of course the double-takes and lingering glances from passerbys and shop vendors tripled, but so did the amount of sweat dripping from every pore of my body. When we finally reached HEAL AFRICA's gates, we were shown to Lyn's office. Completely drenched in sweat and probably not smelling that rosy either, Lyn took one look at us (and our boxes) and asked if we were reporters. Although she was expecting us that morning, she later confessed she didn't know who we were and upon first glance, thought we were journalists who had come to write about the hospital. But once we said we were indeed Matt and Bonnie, albeit a bit dirty and travel-weary, she leaped up from behind her desk, ran over and threw her arms the both of us, squeezing and squealing at the same time. It was nice to see she was so thrilled to have family here; the rest of the day she would proudly introduce us to everyone as "ma famille who came to visit me all the way from Cape Town!!" We had interrupted a meeting of Lyn's and so while she was finishing up, Albert, one of the clinic's staff members, showed us around the reception office, the paediatrics building, the orthopaedics site, the operating theatre (where Jo, Lyn's husband, was busy operating inside), etc. What I noticed almost straight away was how many children, and young ones at that, there were in the clinic rooms and how many more were roaming the hospital grounds. We passed by the hospital school, where the teacher was busy instructing about twenty or so kids in a tiny narrow room. He explained to us that most of these kids have suffered traumatic sexual abuse and while their physical wounds were being treated by the doctors, he was trying to provide a sense of stability and normalcy in their lives by giving daily lessons. Lying in the sun to dry were paintings that the children had just finished creating, many of them self-portraits. There are counsellors working with the kids, many of who encourage art as an effective method used to help them deal with the trauma they experienced. A lot of the time, the children are reluctant to speak about what happened, or perhaps don't even know that what had occurred was "bad" and so wouldn't even know what to say. But kids are still kids, and when I whipped out my camera, they all screamed to be in the photos, clambering all over each other. What a zoo! When I showed them the shots on the screen, the screaming intensified. I was laughing and smiling along with them but inside I couldn't help but feel so sad for them, to be victims at such a young age, and to have such an uncertain future ahead of them. However, one must look at the good fortune these kids have had so far, being able to be treated and healed by the doctors and to have their well-being looked after by their teacher. There are countless number of children who have never, and will probably never, be able to be treated either physically or emotionally for wounds they have suffered. We carried on and passed by the room where the American Bar Association have set up an office to help women who want to file a case against their perpetrator. Even for those who want to stand up for their rights, it is not guaranteed justice will prevail. But it is a small step towards a more just world, and for that reason, it is worth pursuing. More often than not, women are shunned by their village and family if they are raped and are often too ashamed to return. Albert told us that if they return to their village with a new skill (ie. sewing), the integration process will be a bit easier. It also helps if she goes back bearing something of value, like a goat, whereby the villagers will more readily accept her back into the community. While touring the hospital and hearing all the horribles stories, I couldn't help but feel so angry at the desperate situation. Having been told and taught all my life that, as a female, I am entitled to my own identity and dignity but then witnessing the complete opposite to that here was just depressing and terribly frightening. Having to feel ashamed or embarrassed about an act of violence committed against you is plainly unjust to begin with, no matter what act it is or what gender you are. But it is plainly evident that here, when a woman is sexual assaulted, it renders her a lifetime of suffering and guilt, and in a world where she already bears so much hardship and heartache, it is unimaginable how they carry on. Once Lyn was finished her meeting, she took us on a tour of Goma town. UN peacekeepers (Indians, South Africans, Uruguayans) were patrolling the streets everywhere. Congolese police officers were at every street corner manning their road block. While entering a traffic circle, a policeman motioned for us to stop. Apparently they stop cars whenever they feel like it, for no particular reason. Lyn crawled to a halt, reluctantly, just inches away from a policewoman. Lyn instructed us to roll up our windows immediately and let her do the talking. I would be lying if i said my heart wasn't pounding in my chest. Another police officer, a big burly man with a big burly gun to match, swaggered over and greeted Lyn amicably (Lyn is quite well known here, being the wife of Dr. Lusi and having unmistakable curly blond hair) but told her off for failing to stop immediately. He made Lyn apologize to the policewoman, which was all really an act of "I'm in power and you will do what i say". As we continued to drive along Goma's streets, which are really a collection of huge potholes and muddy ditches, we saw the remnants of the Mount Nyiragongo volcano eruption in 2002, one of the most destructive in the world with over 4500 buildings destroyed and 120,000 people left homeless. Lyn told us of her memories of the day, how the road split up and swallowed everything around it, how her and Jo were separated on either side, how they fled Goma by boat on Lake Kivu to the Rwandan side, and how the house they had just moved out of, was swallowed up by the hot-flowing lava in mere seconds. We passed dilapidated houses and shacks, bustling markets with booming music, lots of wooden bicycles (think Flinstone-style) carrying bananas to the market, a man hacking away at a cow's skull with a giant axe (didn't dare get a picture for fear of the $300 fine but I've got the image branded forever in my mind), the lowering of the Congolese flag during a ceremony, in which everyone within sight must stop and standstill - or risk a fine, or worse. After quickly dropping off our bags at the Lusi home and changing into something a little more appropriate (ie. not so smelly), we headed to the Hotel Ihusi where Jo was leading a conference. One of their family friends, David Cohen, was to be giving a presentation entitled "Journee de reflection sur la paix et la reconstruction" (Day of refelction on peace and reconstruction). When we arrived in the parking lot, Jo greeted us outside with a huge bear hug. You could tell he was very happy for Lyn that a relative of hers, distant as it may be, had come to visit. He asked her jokingly, "What shall we feed our guests tonight, Lyn? English custard?" We all went inside to the conference room. When the Governor of North Kivu province walked in, everyone stood up and stayed standing until he sat down. After a few more minutes, the conference began with the singing of the national anthem. The DRC anthem is a solemn and melodic one, but looking around the room at all these smartly-dressed politicians (all men, might I add) singing in unison, my mind yearned to know if they realized how the words they were regurgitating were ones they should actually address to their people. Lyn, Matt and I stayed only for the opening remarks and then quickly escaped to the hotel's restaurant to have a late lunch. It was the first time either of us had met Lyn and so there was a lot of catching up to do. It felt wonderful to talk about the people we knew in common, to hear stories about other relatives and to just extend our family tree by a few more branches. We made a quick phone call to Sue and Guy as well, who are vacationing in France at the moment. Before dinner, we met up with the other HEAL AFRICA staff members for drinks at a nearby hotel/restaurant. We couldn't believe it when we found out that two of them, a married couple, where from Nanaimo BC and even attending Malespina College (now the University of Vancouver Island)! How random to meet someone in the Democratic of Congo who also lives in what will soon be your new home village in Canada. Dinner was at 7pm by the lakeside. The table was beautifully laid out and everyone convened together to share a delicious meal of potatoes, rice, beans, creamy spinach, chicken and peanut sauce. Which brings me to yet another incredible event today: not knowing (and not asking in the first place, which perhaps I should have done) that the chicken was in a peanut sauce, I helped myself to a healthy portion and ate it all without so much a cough. Normally, once peanuts cross my lips I can tell right away and so stop eating immediately. But tonight I didn't even know it was peanut sauce until someone mentioned it after dinner. Feeling a bit nervous after I found out, I was waiting for some sort of allergic reaction to kick in, epipen ready to be injected. Luckily i was surrounded by doctors! But nothing came. Perhaps what the woman from Kisolanza Farm in Iringa, TAN, said was right: the peanuts that grow in East Africa are different than those that are exported abroad since it is during transportation that a certain type of fungus grows on the nuts which is what triggers the allergic reaction. Hence why there are increasing numbers of people allergic to peanuts in North America. Still, I felt I had experienced a tiny miracle. But I don't think I'll be rushing to buy groundnuts or any variety of the sort any time soon. We rounded up our meal with fresh strawberries and then retreated to our bedroom for some much-needed rest. But as tired as I am, I can't seem to fall asleep, my mind still spinning. In a turbulent country such as the DRC, it is inspiring to know that places like HEAL AFRICA exist. Apparently the government hospitals, though it has more shiny buildings and facilities, are devoid of patients because there are simply no skilled doctors or specialists working there. HEAL AFRICA, on the other hand, have gained a reputation of providing good quality service with skilled doctors, and even treat patients who cannot afford it. However, the struggle for obtaining funding is alive and well, but it is true that good people doing good work attract good attention. Over the years, HEAL AFRICA has received quite a lot of media coverage, both in the DRC and internationally. George Clooney has already been for a visit, and Ben Affleck is coming for a second visit this coming Saturday! And they are branching out all over the world; with an office already in Seattle, there are plans for a Canadian office to open in the near future. You have to wonder though, if, when and how this resource-rich country will ever be able to become a leading African nation. The potential is there: the DRC has an estimated $24 trillion US in untapped minerals lying underground. This translates to a lot of prospective wealth for the 63 million inhabitants but unfortunately, it also provides an incentive for too many corrupt undertakings. Perhaps it is for this reason, amongst others, which adds to the unfortunate bad luck that the DRC has been plauged with, from civil war to natural disasters to corrupt political mayhem. In the words of one of HEAL AFRICA's interns, "'Goma ni ajabu', Goma is a miracle. It is really a miracle that daily life functions amidst complete chaos ... the people's work is completely miraculous in spite of everything that is stacked against them." Start: - End: - Distance Traveled: walked across Rwanda/DRC border, toured Goma town Road Conditions: bad bad bad roads in Goma, requires 4-wheel drive and bums of steel Temperature: monstrous thunder and lightning storm at night

After breakfast (home-baked bread and granola, fresh fruit, and delicious local cheese) by the lakeshore, Matt and Charlie (guy we met from Nanaimo) brought the motor down from the boat house to the dock while I had a little go at playing the piano. As soon as the motor was up and running, Lyn took us out to their organic farm just 6km up the lake's shore. They bought the plot of land several years back and are turning it into a community-outreach farming program where students from the university come and learn about agriculture and sustainable farming. There are also long-term plans to build the Lusi Retirement retreat here, and use their present house for guests. After lunch, Lyn dropped us off at the border and wishing we didn't have to leave so soon, we promised to try and visit in the future - perhaps with our children. For an interesting read about the war in Eastern Congo, go to The Roots of War in Eastern Congo. We crossed back into Rwanda, having completed all the formalities in just under 10 minutes. After a bit of a struggle with mobile phone connections, we finally got hold of a taxi who took us back to Paradis Malahide Hotel (8 km away), where we picked up Foxy and headed towards Kinigi. Tonight, we camped at Kinigi Guest House (it had been a while since we used the rooftop tent and it felt really good), had some good tilapia curry dinner and banana brulee for dessert, and went off to bed. Tomorrow would be an early start for my gorilla trekking. I'm so excited. Start: Paradis Malahide Hotel, Gisenyi, RW. 14:50 End: Kinigi Guest House, Kinigi, RW. 16:30 Distance Traveled: crossed back into Rwanda on foot; 80 km (in Foxy) Road Conditions: some road construction, tight bends and plenty of speed bumps in Kinigi. Temperature: rain at night again, chilly

We woke up at 5:30 to the sound of rain, and after a hurried breakfast of coffee and toast, packed up quickly and headed to the Park Gate to start my gorilla trek. Many people say it is a once in a lifetime experience, being with mountain gorillas in their natural environment, and I have to agree. I was placed in a group of 7 (4 Germans, 1 Swiss, 1 Brit and me) and after a brief introduction about gorillas and the specific family we were going to see, I said goodbye to Matt and Foxy and off we went. You never know how long your trek will be since the gorillas move everyday to a new area and only stop to build a nest and sleep at night. You are only allowed to spend one hour with the gorillas, but finding them in the first place can take from 1 hour up to several days. That is why there are 2 trackers who follow each family all day, leaving them only at night when they sleep. They return in the morning and wait for the group of tourists who will arrive with the guide. This eliminates hours and hours of walking in the bush for us. We were pretty lucky today. After trudging uphill in the dense jungle for about an hour, our guide finally managed to locate the trackers using his radio and soon we were face to face with these gorgeous creatures. The rule is you are not allowed to get closer than 7 metres from the gorillas, but it was obvious that the guides and rangers themselves don't follow that regulation. At one point I was literally a couple of metres away from one, staring at him directly in the eyes. It is incredible, you really feel like they are looking right back at you, trying to figure out who you are and maybe why you're so pale and hairless. While I was locked in a staring competition with this one gorilla, I could feel tears of amazement welling up. Our group watched, completely mesmerized, for about 20 minutes while the two babies were play-fighting with each other, stopping only to munch on nearby plants and to beat their chest (a gesture of playfulness). In addition, we saw 3 females (one carrying a tiny baby), 2 adolescents, 1 blackback, and of course, the majestic Silverback gorilla. Our hour was up very quickly and we had to turn around and hike back down to the village, some of us sliding most of the way on the slippery mud. After being reunited with Matt (probably the longest time we've been apart since the beginning of our trip, how strange), we drove to a local restaurant called "Modern Restaurant" for a heavy carb lunch of rice, fries, pasta, beans and meat (all for $2.40 US), and then carried on to the Ugandan border at Kisoro. We had a short wait at the border while the officials were finishing their lunch. After paying $50 US each for a visa and 20,000 Ugandan Shillings for road tax, we were on our way. Again, very easy. Having to readjust to driving on the left side again, we passed some stunning scenery as we drove towards Bunyonyi Overland Camp. The hills are covered in fields and huts, the roads twist and wind their way down to Lake Bunyonyi, and huge container trucks struggle their way uphill in first gear spewing black smoke, it was all incredible. At the campsite, there was a UN Convoy of about 20 Indian Peacekeepers on their way to Goma who had set up camp and were cooking dinner. They offered us a steaming cup of chai tea, but due to some language difficulties, we were unable to converse much. Start: Kinigi Guest House, Kinigi, RW. 06:30 End: Bunyonyi Overland Camp, UG. 18:44 Distance Traveled: 96 km Road Conditions: mostly twisty dirt roads around Lake Bunyonyi Temperature: cloudy

Some notes from today: A long day's drive to Kampala. Passed some nice hilly scenery. Drivers are stubborn and will try to edge you off the road. How much do you really believe "GOD WILL PROTECT?" The men are much taller here, broader. Kids extend their hands and scream "GIVE ME MONEY". It's incessant, and (I find) very rude. We wonder, is it because everyone shares everything here, where the African philosophy is that if you have something, you must share it with your family and friends? That if you're rich, you should give? And because we are perceived as rich (and we are, comparatively) so they ask for money because it is what they would do? Lunched in Lyandonde, all for 9000 Ugandan shillings! Matoke (boiled plantains) and goat stew and rice, and a flat Coke. Great service though. At 2:45 pm we crossed the equator!! We are in the Northern Hemisphere, homeward bound. The steering is off, went to see Chris at his 4x4 Service Garage when we arrived in Kampala. Bushes were shot, shredded and useless. Will come back tomorrow at 8am for them to be replaced. Arrived at Phil and Clare's home and met their two darling girls, Eloise and Ceria. Matt used to play badminton with them when he lived here. They've been living in Uganda for 12 years now. The girls have only ever known life in Uganda (except for visits back to the UK) and are incredibly socialable and confident, a great childhood. They also run HOPE CLINIC LUKULI, a local clinic with free HIV testing, immunization, and a host of other services. One of the main reasons for raising funds for our journey was to contribute to the running costs of HOPE CLINIC, thank you all to those who have! Tonight was all about hot showers, a delicious Mexican dinner and a nice warm bed. Start: Bunyonyi Overland Camp, Bunyonyi, UG. 07:50 End: Phil and Claire's home, Kampala, UG. 16:30 Distance Traveled: 440 km Road Conditions: highway full of holes and speed bumps, nothing extraordinary; road to Phil and Clare's home is literally a single dirt track, and very steep. Temperature: Sweaty and humid today.

A nice leisurely morning was what we needed and exactly what we got. After the mid-morning rain, we had a great lunch on the porch overlooking Lake Victoria. We then got ready and left for Jinja, but not before being delayed by this huge truck struggling uphill in deep mud. He had been digging the dirt road for over an hour and blocking anyone else from coming or going. Apparently this is quite common as the houses on the street are always under construction and these types of huge trucks need to deliver building materials, etc. When we arrived at Jinja, we met Chris and Chiho who had rafted the previous day and were recuperating today. We had dinner together at the Nile River Explorer's Camp and outlined a rough itinerary of our Lake Turkana route in Kenya. Basically, overlanders have two options when going from Kenya to Ethiopia (or vice versa). You can choose to do the Marsabit route, which is reportedly a long stretch of barren land and totally uninspiring. Or the alternative route is to go by Lake Turkana which offers more diverse scenery, people, and lots of dirt roads. It is not a good idea to do the Lake Turkana route in a single vehicle as it is quite remote and chances are you will need help at some point. So we are hoping to do it with one or two more cars, preferably well-equipped ones. The task now is to obtain our Ethiopian visas in Kampala as they do not issue them at the Ileret border (on the Lake Turkana route), and to get our Carnet de Passage stamped (probably in Nairobi), for the same reason. Lots to think and plan about. But first, we had white water rafting on the Nile to look forward to tomorrow!! Start: Phil and Claire's home, Kampala, UG. 14:30 End: Nile River Explorers Camp, Jinja, UG. 17:20 Distance Traveled: 110 km Road Conditions: roads are ok, it's the crazy raving mad buses overtaking at every opportunity that was scary Temperature: cool and cloudy

We filled ourselves with eggs, chapatis, fresh pineapple and toast, included in the price. We took off our wedding rings (and me, my earrings) for fear of losing them in the Nile. We got given our gear: life jacket, helmet and paddle. We met our guides, Nathan and Paulo (a national freestyle champion in kayaking). We met our group, Americans living in Uganda, and named ourselves TEAM UPRIGHT. We survived the first few rapids. We flipped our raft on "50-50". We swallowed too much Nile water. We watched in amazement as all the kayakers practiced their stunts. We saw an otter and lots of birds. We had fresh pineapple and biscuits for lunch. We had a thunderstorm chase us all afternoon. We peed in the Nile. We approached the last rapid of the day: ITANDA Falls (grade 6 rapid). We opted for the "hard approach line" (versus the "Chicken Run" and "Middle Line"). We flipped our raft, obviously. I banged up my knee somehow while being thrown around in the rapids and it hurts like mad. We survived. We sat in the truck for 45 minutes on the way back to camp. We had a huge buffet dinner, included in the price. We took cold showers. We ate mango crumble and vanilla ice cream. We met Dermot and Katie, who are on their one year around the world trip. We watched the video taken of the rafters that day. We bought the video for $45 US. We paid with our traveler's cheques, first time to use them, and got US cash in change! We climbed into our tent, me in agony. We collapsed into deep sleep. No recollection of any dreams, even on a Larium day! Start: - End: - Distance Traveled: down the Nile, about 30 km.

We were on the road back to Kampala by 8am, but not before stopping at a roadside stall to get some breakfast: avocado and veggie chapati. My right knee is so painful I can hardly climb into the car. Thank goodness Matt is driving. Uganda is a country of billboards. There are so many of them, a lot of them quite creative and eye-catching. I spent the day back at Phil and Claire's home, resting on their comfy couch, using their wireless internet and washing machine, and just relishing in home comforts again. Matt went to get Foxy serviced, dropped off our passports at the Ethiopian embassy for visa applications and stocked up on more books, not that we need more, but there are too many to resist. This evening the girls showed me a few songs on the piano that they're learning. Then we launched into some Disney songs, me doing the accompaniment. They're so much fun! After the girls were put to bed (but not before Matt and I did story time duty), we enjoyed a delicious lasagna dinner and sat down to watch "The Constant Gardener" on their PROJECTOR!! What a treat. And a very fitting movie, as we were about to head out to the Lake Turkana region in Kenya. Start: Nile River Explorer Camp, Jinja, UG. 07:36 End: Phil and Clare's home, Kampala, UG. 09:30 Distance Traveled: 110 km Road Conditions: same as on the way here Temperature: drizzly on and off

While I spent another lazy morning at home nursing my knee, Matt went to Chris' 4x4 Service Centre to finish working on Foxy. After doing several loads of laundry over the past few days, we now have a suitcase full of fresh clothes, bed sheets, pillow cases and duvet cover. I'm in love with the smell of clean laundry! We then went to the Garden City Shopping Centre to have some lunch, browse the bookshop (me) and get a haircut (Matt). After swinging by the Ethiopian Embassy to pay ($20 each) and pick up our one-month visa, we returned home to do some painting on Foxy with Eloise and Ceria. We finished just as it started to rain. Tonight we all went out to Fasika's for dinner, a popular Ethiopian restaurant nearby. We dined on delicious injera, curries and lentils, a tasty hint of the cuisine that was to come for us on our journey. Back at home, the girls in bed, we watched an episode of TRIBE (where a guy goes into one of the most remote regions in the world and lives amongst the people). We saw the episode where he joins the Nakhuma Tribe in Ethiopia near Lake Turkana. Very interesting, and again, exciting to think we might meet some of them in a few day's time. Start: - End: - Distance Traveled: just around Kampala Road Conditions: chaotic traffic, especially with the matatus (local minibus) that don't follow any of the road rules and stop anywhere and suddenly to pick up or drop off passengers. Temperature: cool

We said our goodbyes to Phil, Clare and the girls this morning and had them quickly sign Foxy before they rushed off to school/work. We had breakfast and packed our bags. We had to press on, and anyway, it's not a good idea to get too attached to a comfy bed and sofa and TV, etc. Before leaving Kampala, we took a quick tour of Hope Clinic Lukuli. It was HIV treatment day and there were many people waiting to get their antiviral treatment. Just before crossing into Kenya, we used up our cell phone credit by calling home. It's actually pretty impressive how long you can talk for nowadays on just a few Ugandan Shillings worth of credit. We made one call to France and 3 to Canada and we ran out of reception before running out of credit. We entered Kenya at the Malaba border post, probably the busiest border crossing we've been to yet. This is where a lot of cargo (fuel and other goods) cross after arriving in Mombassa, Kenya. Being a landlocked country, Uganda relies heavily on this major highway for their goods to be delivered. Upheaval during the Kenyan elections a few months ago sparked a shortage in almost everything in Uganda. The railway is also under repair and so fuel prices have soared considerably. We've also heard that an oil tanker on the coast has spilled which doesn't help our fuel costs either. We paid the $50 per person visa fee, plus the obligatory $30 road tax, and were on our way. I'm no longer surprised how easy it is to cross African borders. Sure, you get the guys who harass you to change money, sell cell phone SIM cards or "look after your car", but the customs and immigration officials are, for the most part, very competent and efficient. Arriving in Eldoret just before dusk, we came upon Green Acres Hotel by chance. Only having been open for 5 months, they certainly have put a lot of effort into publicizing their place. We spotted their big, shiny signs from the town's outskirts, which is a welcome change from most other hotels that don't seem to bother with any advertising or signage, making navigation a nightmare. Tonight was the Champions League Final, Chelsea vs. Manchester United. Even if Liverpool (Matt's favourite team) wasn't playing we figured it would be an exciting game to see. Luckily, there was a place just a few hundred metres away showing the match. Douglas, one of the hotel staff and a keen football fan, said he would take us there, and in fact he had already booked three seats! After a long's day drive, you can really work up a hearty appetite and we were absolutely famished. Douglas showed us to a nearby 'restaurant' serving local food at local prices. Sitting on plastic chairs at a plastic table with a plastic tablecloth, we ate beef stew, some type of spinach-like vegetable, rice and posho (local word for the common starch, ground up maize or ugali), all for the equivalent of a few U.S. dollars. We then went back to our hotel room and read in comfort until Douglas came to get us at 20:15 to go and see the game. Kickoff wasn't until 21:45 local time but we wanted to go early to make sure our 'reserved seats' weren't taken. In the dark, we carefully plodded through puddles, rubbish and goat faeces to arrive at the venue. Douglas said this part of Eldoret was "the ghetto" and not many people got to experience this side of town so we "were very fortunate." Carefully trying to feet my way around the roads, I was reminded how sharp African eyes were compared to my Western ones, having grown up in neighbourhoods with bright streetlights and a reliable electricity system. The game was being shown in a hut no larger than a small barn, constructed of wooden panels and a corrugated roof. Inside there were about ten long benches squeezed closely together and a smallish TV (my guess would be about a 20 inch screen) propped up in front. The place was already packed with a couple hundred guys, both sitting and standing, but we managed to squeeze into the last row. So much for our reserved seats! While waiting for the match to begin, I noticed how quiet and well-behaved everybody was. We were the only foreigners in the crowd and I was the only female. How bizarre it was to see so many boys and men seated so obediently, so quietly, eyes glued to the screen. But of course that moment did not last long; the second the players ran onto the field, everyone was standing and cheering and screaming. It's quite astonishing how loud it can get when you put rowdy men in a small contained area. The whole experience was surreal, watching football with probably the most devoted football fans in Eldoret's ghetto, not being able to hear a word the commentators were saying because there was so much talking and cheering (all in Kiswahili unfortunately), and at some points not being able to see the screen because someone had bolted upright from all his pent-up excitement and was blocking the small screen. The day was already a long one and I was quite tired. As much as I desperately tried to keep my eyes open, I floated in between feeling like this was a surreal dream to actually falling asleep sitting up. The game eventually went into overtime and then penalty shots, but I still managed to doze in and out of sleep despite all the ruckus. Luckily the entire room was dark and nobody could see my eyes were closed, except for Matt who poked me every so often so that my head wouldn't droop onto Douglas' shoulder. When the final whistle blew and Manchester United won, the crowd burst into applause and cheers and with that, everyone rushed outside where cars were honking and people singing. We returned the empty bottles at the nearby bar, got our deposit and walked back to the hotel where we collapsed into bed. What a night! Start: Phil and Clare's home, Kampala, UG. 09:30 End: Green Pastures Hotel, Eldoret, KENYA. 17:40 Distance Traveled: 355 km Road Conditions: lots of detours on rough dirt track, heavy traffic making passing very difficult. Temperature: pleasant

After last night's late game, our aim to wake up early and be off by 6 am didn't exactly happen. Instead, we got up at 7 o'clock, read in bed and only after a delicious breakfast (included) at Green Hotel's restaurant (cereal, beans, eggs, and crepes with SYRUP) did we leave. Passing the Great Rift Valley (which certainly lives up to its name), we saw hundreds of flamingos in Lake Naivasha, a freshwater lake home to the African fish eagle. Beautiful scenery doesn't mean beautiful roads though. This part of the highway is currently under construction (a huge project headed by the Chinese) and so the detour, from Eldoret to Nakuru, is being used by trucks, buses, cars and donkey-carts alike. It is horribly corrugated, potholed and dusty. I was reminded of those vibrating machines that are sold for people who want to lose wait by putting on a vibrating 'belt'. There is absolutely no need for that, just drive Kenya's roads and without a doubt, you will shed a couple of pounds. A disappointing discovery today: the air-conditioner that was installed in Mwanza doesn't actually work. It functioned fairly effectively when we tried it the day after it was put in, but since then we haven't had to use it. Until today. And when we switched it on, the fan blew out a gust of sand and dust - and lots of hot air. We aren't quite sure why it's malfunctioning, and none of the other guys know either. In fact, nobody else we've met on our journey has air-conditioning in their car. We stopped in Nakuru, Kenya's 4th largest city, for lunch at the local Lemon Tart Caf&#xE9;. We parked Foxy in front of some stalls where men were selling crafts and other souvenirs. When we tried to buy a newspaper, the vendor tried to charge us double the rate, when in fact the price of the paper is printed on the front page! We exchanged a few heated words and then walked away. We've been told to be careful while in Kenya, especially Nairobi, as people are notorious for being corrupt and cunning, especially towards innocent and na&#xEF;ve muzungus. We arrived at Nairobi's Jungle Junction campsite and met the owner, a friendly German fellow (married to a Kenyan with 5 girls), and several other travellers. This place is an essential stop for any overlanders going north or south of Nairobi. In the lounge there are maps, GPS coordinates and loads of information for onward travel. There is also a laundry service, a fully-stocked fridge and a big communal kitchen. Outside there is a big grassy lawn to camp on and also a workshop area to repair your Landrover (or motorbike or whatever). Everyone calls this place a haven. For me, it's nice to meet other people who have been on the road for weeks/months in Africa, and to be able to talk about your route, your vehicle, your experiences at getting ripped off... After a quick shower, a few of us walked to the nearby shopping centre and bought some groceries for dinner. What a treat to be grocery shopping again! I didn't realize how much I missed shopping so much, the variety of goods seemed endless! We had to stop ourselves after our trolley was nearly full. We opted to share a taxi back to Jungle Junction, even if it was only a couple of kilometres. It was already dark so walking back wouldn't be wise and besides, it would be a bit of a struggle carrying all of our bags. By the time we finished preparing and eating our potluck dinner (we prepared Chakalaka fish creole to go along with the breaded mushrooms, tuna pasta and salads), it was practically midnight before we climbed into bed. Another late night, but we went to sleep happy that we had reached Nairobi safely. Like everybody says, heading north from Nairobi is where the tough part of the journey begins. Start: Green Pastures Hotel, Eldoret, KEN. 10:00 End: Jungle Junction Camp, Nairobi, KEN. 17:00 Distance Traveled: 310 km Road Conditions: horrendous from Eldoret to Nakuru, absolutely horrendous. And then smooth tar with PAINTED LINES from Nakuru to Nairobi. Temperature: cloudy, cool at night.

It was not the restful night we had hoped for. So far this trip we have been lucky and not had one mosquito in our tent - until last night. We had left the side vents open by mistake when we put the tent up and that's probably where they came in. Along with the dogs barking (they do it here too!), it was a fitful sleep to say the least. Yesterday we met Thomas (German) travelling solo in his Toyota Land Cruiser. He started 9 months ago in his native Koln home, going down West Africa and eventually winding his way back through the Middle East like us. Together with Chiho and Christoph, the five of us will journey up through the Lake Turkana region, crossing into the Omo valley in Ethiopia. Everyone says it is better to travel in convoy, safety in numbers - for bandits and breakdowns. Since you cannot get an exit stamp for your passport or Carnet de Passage at the border crossing in Illeret/Omorate, we have to do so at Customs in Nairobi first. Once we arrive in Addis Ababa, we will have to get our entry stamp for Ethiopia. At 8:30am sharp, our pre-arranged taxi arrived and the 5 of us squeezed into his car and off we went to the Immigration and Customs building in the city centre. We had heard from previous travellers that, depending on the mood of the officers, sometimes they will refuse to issue you a stamp and where "girls must flirt and guys must beg." Fortunately we didn't have to resort to any of that. It seems they are used to a lot of Overlanders doing the same route and the whole procedure was extremely efficient and painless. The taxi driver, whom we had hired on an hourly rate, then drove us to the nearby 4x4 Parts Store so we could buy some new bushes. After the bumpy roads from yesterday, ours looked like shredded cheese. We were back at Jungle Junction before noon where we spent the afternoon relaxing and preparing Foxy for the next leg of the trip, probably the most difficult one to come. A nice purple bruise is forming on my leg; it's in the exact shape of Malawi. Having never broken a bone in my life, I realize how dependent we are on our able bodies. I'm trying not to let this leg of mine get the better of me, but the pain and discomfort and lack of mobility is causing my patience to thin. But it's nothing a good hearty meal at the Nairobi Caf&#xE9; - with free wireless connection - couldn't fix. Start: - End: - Distance Traveled: - Road Conditions: Nairobi traffic is the hazard, not the potholes. Our taxi almost ran over a cyclist who darted out in front of us, it was very very close. Temperature: cool, breezy, cloudy. ps. Happy Birthday Alli!

After paying our bill and bidding farewell to the other overlanders going southbound, we were off to Lake Turkana! Christoph and Chiho led the way in their Landy, followed by Thomas in his Land Cruiser and then us in Foxy. We stalled Foxy just as we were leaving the campsite, hopefully not a bad omen for the journey! After a pleasant morning drive, we stopped at the Trout Tree Restaurant for lunch. Set amongst a forest (you eat in treehouse-type platforms), it has earned quite a reputation for being a popular weekend getaway for Nairobians. The setting was exquisite and we watched the monkeys play in the trees while we chomped on our tasty trout (lucky me, nobody ate their fish heads so I ended up with 5 on my plate). We drove on a bit further and then stopped at the equator again, but this time on the Kenyan side. As if on cue, a mob of men selling t-shirts, Maasai Mara spears and other paraphernalia swarmed us. One of them, a jolly talkative fellow, was wearing a pin featuring Barack Obama, who is half-Kenyan. He claimed to have "family relations" with the Obama family and was evidently proud of it. We arrived in Isiolo around dusk and headed for the recommended campsite in our guidebook. Unfortunately there was going to be a huge wedding reception there later that night, with over 200 guests, live music "until at least 3 or 4 in the morning", and even security guards checking everyone's invitations. An American diplomat was marrying a local woman and it seems everyone and their second-cousin was invited. So we decided to retrace our path a bit and camp at Rangeland Camp instead, just outside Isiolo town. There was no water or electricity there and the staff members were simply quite rude. But we didn't mind. We were on a long road journey and it was only day one, and nothing could sour our mood. Christoph got busy with his axe and we had bbq'd lamb chops and vegetable stew for dinner. Along with cold beers and Cokes (Thomas has an identical fridge/freezer like ours), we finished off with some dark Lindt chocolate around the campfire while admiring the stars. This is THE LIFE! Start: Jungle Junction, Nairobi, KENYA. 09:30 End: Rangeland Camp, Isiolo, KENYA. 16:30 Distance Traveled: 295 km Road Conditions: - Temperature: dusty, cool

While trying to avoid a herd of goats (who always seem to be in a constant state of confusion as to which side of the road they should be on), Thomas ran over one of them with his back wheel. We were right behind him and saw the whole thing. It is definitely not something I would like to remember. As soon as it happened, the kids who were herding the goats ran up to him demanding payment. He handed over 1000 Shilling note and sped off. Besides that little piece of excitement, the drive today was pretty decent. At first, it was extremely dusty but then suddenly, green lush hills appeared out of nowhere. What a great sight, to see life! After filling up on diesel and buying some supplies for lunch (bread and fruit) in Maralal, we continued north for another hour until the sun was just about to set. Not wanting to drive in the dark, we were going to just drive off the road, out of sight from passing vehicles and set up camp. Luckily, we just so happened to spot a little wooden sign on the road up ahead with the word "Camping" and so we tried that track instead. It turns out it was a campsite that was still under construction but the men told us, in their limited English, that we could stay there free of charge. There were about 5 or 6 guys, all wrapped up in Kenyan blankets with AK-47 rifles slung around their shoulders. Totally non-threatening though and extremely friendly, they even started our campfire for us. We cooked up some pasta to go with our bbq'd lamb chops. It was extremely windy and cold up on the ridge but the view was really stunning. We wrapped ourselves in scarves and hats, and huddled close to the fire to keep warm. With no showers, electricity or running water (second night in a row, hmmmm... will this be a daily occurrence?), we devoured our dinner and Lindt chocolate dessert and climbed into bed. Start: Rangeland Camp, Isiolo, KENYA. 09:30 End: Bush Camp at a Campsite which was still being constructed. 17:15 Distance Traveled: 233 km Road Conditions: dirt tracks, manageable Temperature: very windy and cold at night

Another hot and dusty driving day. We passed many little villages, all somewhat identical with their main street lined with tiny stores selling soaps, candles, bread, matches, and tins of tomatoes. People lounged around under the big trees, chatting, squatting, eating. People don't always like having their picture taken here and I've been quite reluctant to just point and click, even when we're driving. I feel like I can't just snap a quick shot just for my own sake, but it's very tempting. The people from this Lake Turkana region are some of the most stunning individuals I've ever laid eyes on. Their brightly coloured clothes are magnificent, and set against the pale dusty landscape, it appears that much more dazzling. The shower felt wonderful when we arrived at Palm Shade Camp in Loyangalani. We didn't even mind that it wasn't hot. But for 450 Shillings per person here - to CAMP! - it's a definite rip off. Someone (i won't mention who in our party of 5) remarked that "everything smells like poo around here", and it did. Even less reason to fork over the camping fee. But we were too tired and lazy to find another campsite, not knowing if it would be better or not. None of us felt like cooking tonight so we ordered the 'local dinner' from the camp. We paid 1000 Shillings for the ingredients for dinner, plus 400 Shillings for labour cost. A delicious feast was brought to us an hour later: five full-sized tilapia fish, an enormous bowl of rice, cabbage, sauce and oranges. The tilapia was perfectly grilled, and again I was the lucky one who got the remnants of everyone's bones and fish heads. FYI, fish cheeks are the best and most tender part of the entire fish. Try it once and you'll be hooked. We ate and drank like royalty late into the night. At some point, someone in charge came to tell us "sorry, we have to turn off the generator." No problem, we kept chatting in the dark. I noticed tonight that I'm developing a blister on my top lip. I hadn't realized how strong the sun was (duh) and made a mental reminder to be more vigilant in applying sunscreen. Start: Campsite in Progress, on road in Northern Kenya. 09:07 End: Palm Shade Camp, Loyangalani, KENYA. 17:00 Distance Traveled: 200 km Road Conditions: luckily the rain has held off so far and we've been crossing mainly dry riverbeds Temperature: hot and dry, and really dusty

I woke up this morning with my lip blister twice as big and ten times more annoying. It is very difficult not to lick or touch it, but I know I shouldn't. The urge to pop it is enormous. We drove through some amazing scenery today. It looked like we were on the moon. So much so that during our lunch break, Matt and I played "raise the flag". In the afternoon, we bumped and rolled over volcanic rocks, all pretty big and all very sharp. And then it happened. We heard a big crack and pop. We stopped and looked under Foxy and saw that the right rear bush on the spring was completely gone, as was the metal disc. After a few appropriate words better left unwritten here, we got busy. We tried to screw on a new bush and nut, but the grooves of the screw didn't match the fine lines of the nut. Thomas tried to explain it to us, being an engineer who produces such springs: you may have one screw with different groove measurements at either end, like even a tenth of a millimetre difference. This is to ensure a more complete fit. But to us it was useless; one nut was completely missing, lost in the volcanic rubble somewhere. In the end, Christoph and Chiho came to our rescue. In their Landy, they literally carry every single spare part to completely rebuild a Landrover from scratch. They had a brand new shock and in the end, we had to completely remove ours and use theirs just so the nut and screw combination would fit. Profoundly thankful - we don't know what we would've done if we were alone - we kept driving. Just as the sun was setting, we got our first glimpse of Lake Turkana. It is indeed a beautiful lake, shimmering like a diamond, inviting all who set eyes on it to come closer to the edge. Due to our delay with fixing Foxy, we set up bush camp around dusk. We had bbq'd hamburgers, vegetable soup and noodles for dinner. We each finished off with a Coffee Crisp for dessert, sent to us to South Africa months ago from various loved ones back home. THANK YOU! It's probably the first time Coffee Crisps have ever been appreciated in the great wild bush of Lake Turkana! Start: Palm Shade Camp, Loyangalani, KENYA. End: Bush Camp (at coordinates N 03 32.335' E 036 24.123'), KENYA. 17:22 Distance Traveled: 132 km Road Conditions: Average speed all day was 28.5 km/hr Temperature: we are just a little over 500 metres above sea level and it's extremely humid.

We arrived at Sibiloi National Park gate in mid-morning and paid our dues: $40 per person Park Fee, 300 Shillings per car and $15 per person camp fee. We bought a map of the Park and drove a few more hours to reach the camp site at Lake Turkana's edge. We couldn't believe this was a National Park, there was absolutely nothing but dry bush and dirt, oh and the occasional skinny rabbit. In a bleak and barren sense, it was really beautiful. Arriving around mid-day, it was just insanely hot. At an elevation of 365 m above sea level, we quickly ate lunch (I can't even remember what it was anymore it was so hot) and after ensuring this part of the lake was bilharzia-free (it was), we raced into the water. Expecting a hot bath, the water's temperature was actually pretty cool. Very nice. The rest of the afternoon was spent lounging around in the shade of the building, reading, showering and for me, napping. Start: Bush Camp (coordinates N 03 32.335' E 036 24.123'), KENYA. 09:17 End: Sibiloi National Park Camp, KENYA. 12:00 Distance Traveled: 70.19 km Road Conditions: Our overall average was 27.6km/hr (with a max speed of 50.9 km/hr) which gives a general indication of how the 'roads' were. Temperature: hottest we've been yet this whole trip. Certainly above 40 Celsius during midday.

Leaving the campsite this morning was a rather difficult affair. Just as we started our engines, the self-appointed manager of the campsite raced up to us and demanded we pay him $50 US dollars. We told him we had already paid our $15 per person camping fee yesterday at the Park Gate, which was already a steep fee, and there was no way we would pay another extra 'fee'. He then went on to say we must pay because we visited the Sibiloi Museum (where there are artifacts of human and animal bones, etc). This got us really angry because we did not visit any museum of any sort and he was obviously trying to make some money out of us for his own sake. After a few heated words and realizing he was not going to back down, we got in our respective cars and sped off, spewing black exhaust smoke all over him. When we got to Illeret, the next biggest town just before the Ethiopian border, we made a wrong turn and we all ended up at the police compound unintentionally. The big police chief honcho swaggers out of his office and demands to see our passports. The gate is closed, there are armed guards everywhere and we are at his mercy so we reluctantly hand over our documents. He has been waiting for our arrival, he tells us slyly. Apparently the manager at the Sibiloi campsite radioed him after our hasty departure telling him of the "unpaid museum fees." The next few hours were spent trying to explain our situation to the police chief. Holding five foreigners in police custody without an appropriate charge was obviously the biggest event he's had in a while and he was living it up. He said the only way we could leave was if we paid the fee. And if we really wanted to sort it out with the Park manager, just wait a little bit while because he was coming by speedboat "right this minute." But it was getting late in the day and we had barely covered the distance we wanted to. We waited and waited in the baking heat as the Police Chief was shouting on the radio with one of the Museum staff members. We all wished we could understand Swahili. At this point, we decided amongst ourselves that this was an obvious ploy to try and squeeze as much money out of us muzungus and this was all a struggle of power, and the one who backs down first is weaker. We didn't care much about our pride, but the principle of the whole matter was hanging in the air. If he can swindle money illegally out of us foreigners, then he'll try again with the next batch. It sets a bad precedent, and already, this Police Chief of Illeret was just using his authority to flex his muscles and I highly doubt he was respected in this village. Finally, he saunters out again of his office after hanging up on the radio and what he said next totally surprised us. He said he would let us go without any problem as long as he can copy down our passport details and the booking receipt numbers for the campsite. And when the Camp Manager arrives by speedboat, he can take it up with Park HQ at the gate (where we had paid initially). Great that was easy, we thought. His demeanour did a 180 turn and suddenly he was this jovial man acting like we were old friends. Very strange. He even ended up signing our car "Karibu Kenya" (Welcome to Kenya) and "Mutimba - Illerate Police Station. Nice time guys." Passports back in our possession, handshakes all around, gates opened, we were off again. Big sigh of relief. At exactly 15:13, we crossed over into Ethiopia. No border police controls, no immigration, no customs, nothing. Just sand and bare trees and some goats and a few tin huts dotted around. We stopped at the Omo River at Omorate at dusk, got our passports stamped at the customs 'office' (bare room with one desk) and decided to carry on a few more kilometres out of town before setting up bush camp. The grass was like huge needles sticking out of the ground and we had to clear a large area with axes before walking around. We camped at an elevation of 390 metres, so needless to say (again), it was hot. Start: Sibiloi National Park Campsite, KENYA. 09:58 End: Bush Camp near Omorate, ETH. 17:30 Distance Traveled: 162 km Road Conditions: dirt Temperature: HOT, DRY, DUSTY all day and all night. * Dankeschoen to Thomas for providing some of the pics in this Omo Valley section!

I'm in Jinka sitting in the Jinka Resort ('resort' is a relative term around here) restaurant with a Dutch family in front of me and some Ethiopian music in the background. I am at peace now, especially having had a bit of time to just sit and think and write. I am clean after a few days of intense heat, dust and sun. It is a nice feeling, to be clean and well-fed. The lovely manager here did everything to make us feel at home, the most appreciated thing being the use of one of the free chalet rooms to have a hot shower (campers are normally only allowed the cold showers in the back). Today we passed some remote tribe members along our route. Just in this region alone, there are about a dozen different tribes, all very different and all very proud, so much so that some tribes are still warring against each other. When we stopped for a quick lunch en route, three Hamer tribe adolescents came up to us, at first they were very shy but they didn't take long to warm up to us and pretty soon they were posing for our cameras. The women have intricate hairstyles, using the red mud to twist their hair into amazing dreads. Almost all the men here carry Kalashnikovs (aka: AK47); I've seen so many now I'm no longer shocked. It has been an interesting journey being with Thomas, Chiho and Christoph. It has almost been a week we've all been traveling together. It is fortunate that we all get along, that we're of similar age and that we all can speak one common language. This Lake Turkana section of our big Africa trip is special and will definitely stick in my mind as a highlight for years to come. The desolate landscape, the people we've come across (both kind and deceitful), the meals we've shared, all of it adds up to the great Turkana experience. ~ It's Dad's EMBA convocation today, and I hope it all goes well. I am truly sorry I cannot be there to support him in the audience. I hope he knows how proud I am of him, and how he has always been such a good role model for me. Congrats to you and your class! Start: Bush Camp near Omorate, ETH. 09:30 (3:30 local time) End: Jinka Resort, Jinka, ETH. 15:00 (9 o'clock local time) Distance Traveled: 180 km Road Conditions: Omorate to Turmi rough dirt tracks, Turmi to Jinka pretty smooth alongside road that's being constructed. Overall Average: 34.01 km/hr Max Speed: 75.4 km/hr (but that didn't last long) Temperature: hot, dry and dusty in the morning becoming cool and comfortable in evening.

Last night was an eventful one. We found out that we had parked our cars on an anthill, the kind of ants that bite. These things are vicious. They find their way into your shirt and pants somehow and cause you to jump around and strip right then and there. Luckily it was dark and we have all become accustomed to each other already, more than the average friendship perhaps, having traveled together for several days. However, the night-guard that was perched in his little tree-hut above us was another story. I'm sure he found it hilarious. Also, Matt had a terribly scarring experience in the middle of the night when he had to suddenly go to the toilet. His fear was compounded with the fact that he had to climb out of the tent and navigate his way through the ants in the dark. We deduced that the cheeseburger he had eaten last night was not exactly cooked properly; Chiho and Christoph, who also ate cheeseburgers, experienced similar results. This morning we visited Jinka's market, only held twice a week. It was a colourful, chaotic place, with lots of livestock and cabbage for sale. It reminded me of when I used to live in northern Ghana and had to visit the local market every week for fresh produce, buying mangoes and onions from the same women so not to get ripped off. The smells, colours, and village chatter all came flooding back, and it made me nostalgic for the simple life again. What I don't miss is the constant begging and asking. Here in Ethiopia it seems more severe. Kids and adults are incessantly shouting out: "You you you you! Give me pen!" Substitute 'pen' with 'dollars, money, Carmella (sweets, as they say in Italian), and Highland' (which we later found out refers to the big plastic water bottles), and you begin to dread who you'll meet around the next corner. While driving in the afternoon, Christoph and Chiho's tire went flat, but they are so used to changing tires now they were finished in under 10 minutes. Matt and I have yet to change a tire on the road, but I'm sure it would take us just 10 minutes to detach the hi-lift jack from Foxy. We arrived at the Green Hotel in Konso just as it was getting dark. For 30 birr/car and 90 birr for the use of a toilet/shower, we camped in their gravel parking lot. It was listed as the best camping option in Konso; we didn't want to think what the other options were like. We walked into town and had dinner at Edget Hotel, where the "food is the best Konso has to offer". We devoured our first injera dinner in Ethiopia, along with a mountain of and tibs and eggs. Well, Matt and I did at least. Between the two of us we ate twice as much as the other three combined. It was delicious. ~ Happy Wedding Mike and Kat! Wish we were there with you all drinking champagne in Niagara Falls! Start: Jinka Resort, Jinka, ETH. 13:30 End: Green Hotel, Konso, ETH. 18:30 Distance Traveled: 137 km Road Conditions: lots of windy detours, average speed of 34 km/hr and max speed of 72.5 km/hr. Temperature: camping at an altitude of 1450 m, very pleasant.

Why is there so much begging in Ethiopia? That is the question that has plagued my mind these days. I wonder if it isn't the after effects of Ethiopia's unfortunate 1984-1985 famine where thousands of aid workers flooded the country and handed out food rations like candy cane at a Christmas parade. Kids, adults, old women, they all do it. Hands outstretched, asking for something. Do people just expect handouts now from foreigners since that is all they know? Giving to people who are starving is one thing. Giving to redeem your guilt is another. Start: Green Hotel, Konso, ETH. 09:00 End: Adenium Campsite, Awassa, ETH. 17:30 Distance Traveled: 359 km Road Conditions: horrendous potholes from Arba Minch to the A2, and then pretty good until Awassa. Overall Average: 51.1 km/hr Max Speed: 103 km/hr (wow!) Temperature: humid, rainy

Met up with Ragna and Amiram today, ex-colleagues of Matt's from Conergy. They used to work in the Singapore office and like Matt, decided to leave the company after it was plagued with problems, and do the next best thing: travel Africa. The two are avid cyclists and are taking a year to explore this vast continent by bike, stopping along the way to give workshops and seminars on environmental conservation, the benefits of tree planting, etc. Check out their excellent website: Cycle Generation. They just spent the past few days in Bale National Park hiking and spotting the elusive Ethiopian wolf. It was nice to see them and catch up. We took them to Adenium Campsite afterwards and introduced them to Jana, the German owner. We thought they might appreciate some of Jana's delicious vegetarian cooking (a fusion of German and Ethiopian tastes) before they head down to Kenya via Marsabit. Arriving in Addis was not a pleasant experience. About 30 km south of Addis there were huge traffic jams and we were literally inching ahead for a couple of hours. By the time we reached the city, it was dark, rainy and extremely difficult to navigate. Kids would jump over the highway fences and then bolt full speed to the other side. We nearly hit one boy. We arrived at Ithegue Taitu Hotel and found Christoph and Chiho. We shared an injera dinner and caught up on the past few days' activities. We decided to take one of the cheap rooms instead of camp in the parking lot. I have to say, though, I do prefer our tent's comfort and coziness to the small, dark hotel room we got given, with stained sheets and a springy mattreess. And not only was there no hot water, there was no water to speak of at all. With no shower, no way to flush the toilet or brush our teeth, we dreamed of a better tomorrow. Start: Adenium Campsite, Awassa, ETH. 14:00 End: Ithegue Taitu Hotel, Addis Ababa. 20:00 Distance Traveled: a little over 150 km, can't remember exact distance Road Conditions: traffic jams and mad pedestrians everywhere. Temperature: rainy at night

So this is what it feels like to enter civilization after having zero contact with the rest of the world while in one of the world's most remote areas: IMMENSE RELIEF, UTTER EXHAUSTION, and COMPLETE SATISFACTION. This is just a little note for beloved ones back home to know we are safe and healthy in rainy Addis Ababa. Intermittent internet connection (no way to upload photos yet i'm afraid, nobody allows me to use my own laptop), mud and dust and disgusting pollution, gorgeous people with warm smiles, shoe-shine boys no more than 10 years old harassing you at every opportunity, and the typical "African bureaucracy" when trying to change money, hail a cab, barter for an item. Addis is like being plopped into another planet where we don't understand the language or the script, where there are beautiful churches every few metres, and in between cafes and bars and roadside stalls selling fruit and meat. And everywhere, absolutely EVERYWHERE there are people, old, young (lots of em), and many pregnant women (very high birthrate in Ethiopia and depending on who you ask, a National Family Planning campaign missing in action). We stayed in a rather musky hotel room last night at the Itegue Taitu Hotel, recommended by the LP, but we're moving elsewhere tonight. We have sent in about 10 kilos worth of laundry to be done but everyone here charges washing by the item, so I'm not looking forward to the final bill. Still, we can't leave it too much longer or else something fungus-like will certainly start to multiply in our sturdy yellow bucket, which is so over-stuffed that we've had to start using our big plastic bags, aka: bio-hazard. So we are using Addis as a temporary base to get our Sudanese and Egyptian visas for onward travel, to catch up on admin stuff for back home (school for Matt and job hunting for me), and to just catch our breath and sleep uninterrupted for hours on end. Enough for now. SO much to say about the past few weeks but will need a day or two to digest it all. Have had some incredible (both in the good and bad sense) off-road experiences, some strange insect bites, some wonderful starry nights by the campfire, and some impromptu meetings with the remote tribes of the Omo valley, where topless women wear huge round plates in their lips and where all the men sport the tiniest miniskirts imaginable and carry AK-47's slung over their shoulders, plus a round of bullets in their leather belt. Incredible! At least the police chief who detained us didn't put his weapon to the test! Civilization? Yup, we're back in it.

I had my wallet stolen yesterday. I'm not impressed. There was a wad of fresh Birr notes from the bank, where i had just gone to change traveler's cheques in the morning. Luckily, I only had my South African VISA card in there, and not any others. We called Johannesburg and had it cancelled immediately. On top of all that, we had a terrible sleep last night so we are moving to Wanza Hotel in the "New Addis" neighbourhood, the place where young and cool people go to shop and drink macchiatos. Yes, the one saving grace about Addis is the delicious coffees and lattes you can get, thanks to the Italians. It's all top quality, and ridiculously cheap. They also left quite a legacy of good pizza and pastas, and some of the buildings have art-deco type designs, all very pleasing to the eye. Business-wise, we accomplished quite a bit today. After picking up our Egyptian visas and dropping off the passports at the Sudanese Embassy for Sudan visa applications, we went to African Lakes Auto to fix a few things on Foxy. We lunched at the government-run Ghenet Hotel. They had a bowling alley, tennis court and impressive gardens. There was a monstrous thundershower tonight, so loud that we had to shout at each other to be heard. We ate at Wanza Hotel's little restaurant and went to sleep in our tent. It seems it is quite impossible to get a good night's sleep in Addis; there was loud banging on the gate all night and a huge bitter row between a prostitute and several drunken clients. All this happened right beside Foxy, and underneath us while we tried to sleep. The yelling was in Amharic sprinkled with Arabic and English. Even though we couldn't understand most of it, one doesn't really need to comprehend the words to recognize the tone. Start: Wanza Hotel, Addis Ababa, ETH. End: Wanza Hotel, Addis Ababa, ETH. Distance Traveled: 0 km Road Conditions: - Temperature: rain, dreary and polluted, but otherwise cool.

Today was an up day. It didn't rain one drop. This is important because we don't have to fold the tent away wet. We got the last of our clothes washed. My orange fleece was filthy. We picked up our Sudanese visas at the embassy at 3pm. No questions asked, we walked out within 5 minutes! And we were all so worried about getting a 2 week transit visa after hearing and reading so many horror stories from other Overlanders. We even managed to change some Ethiopian Birr to Sudanese Pounds with a couple of German travellers who had just come from Sudan. There was the typical slow internet connection today, interrupted by several power outages, but we managed to book our London to Toronto flight for August 13. And with Sue's great help, we have our ferry tickets from France to Jersey (July 28) and from Jersey to England (Aug. 3)!! It's all very exciting now that we have official dates. It seems real, final and definite. We will make it home. Tonight we went to the Rainbow Korean Restaurant for dinner. It was good, genuine, wholesome Korean food. Amazing, who would have thought, in Addis?? There was no electricity (not a surprise anymore), so we dined by candlelight. When we got back to Wanza Hotel, Thomas was there with his Toyota squeezed into the courtyard. He had gone up to Bale National Park for a couple of days before coming to Addis. The electricity was back on so we took a HOT SHOWER and devoured the chocolate cake we bought at a caf&#xE9; earlier for dessert, divine! And another bonus, there was no yelling or banging at night. Just Matt sleeptalking. Start: Wanza Hotel, Addis Ababa, ETH. End: Wanza Hotel, Addis Ababa, ETH. Distance Traveled: 0 km Road Conditions: - Temperature: pleasant

Leaving Addis today, heading north, we took the wrong road out onto the Ring Road. It was a long day of driving. A few observations from the window: There are donkeys everywhere, carrying cement blocks, wood, buckets, people, everything. We had bad roads until after Debre Berha, where then we passed through a one-lane tunnel cut into the mountain. You must make sure nobody is coming in the other direction, especially a car with missing headlights. Our highest point passed today was 3800 metres! There is plenty of deforestation. And yet Ethiopia is still quite green and fertile. People dress differently here, many more head scarves are worn by women, men are in sarongs and turbans. We encountered some random and strange gestures from people on the road: frantic waving, pointing, shaking sticks and charging full speed at us, hands out asking, begging, airplane motions. What do they all mean? We slept at Harego Lodge in Kombolcha. Not because we wanted to but because it was dark and we didn't want to continue driving. There was, you guessed it, no electricity so I took a cold shower and we drank warm beers. Matt wasn't feeling well so we took a room. But that meant spending an hour killing mosquitoes before we could go to sleep. The mattress was hard as a rock and the plastic covering was still on mine. Tomorrow we sleep in our tent.

Today was a day of varied scenery and temperature. At one point we were 3535 metres high, cold and windy. At another point we were staring into the deep gorges of the mountainside, dusty and damp from the long stretches of road construction. We passed a couple of tanks on the side of a cliff, a sobering reminder of the war that wasn't so long ago. We drove deep into the Lasta Mountains, known as "Africa's Petra", and the last 14 km into Lalibela were the most awe-inspiring with stunning mountainous scenery and smooth uninterrupted tarmac road, all paid for by UNESCO. We arrived at the Roha Hotel just in time to see a wedding party dancing and singing in the parking lot. They were all just getting into cars and heading out. The bride looked absolutely stunning, and totally subdued for some reason or other. After not having had a shower in a few days, if you don't count the cold drip shower last night in the insect-infested 'shower room', I was desperate to scrub the dirt and dust off my body. The receptionist told us the electricity (for hot water) was only on tonight from 6-8pm and that "tomorrow there may be no power at all because well, you know, it is Lalibela and very unpredictable, so you better shower tonight." He didn't need to tell me twice. Although we are camping in their garden, we got given a hotel room to use the shower and toilet. What an impressive hotel it is, with a sit-down toilet that actually flushes (we all cheered when water came gushing out!) and a bathtub and shower head that spouts hot hot hot water at full force! Why does a hot shower feel so good? I don't know, but it certainly does. Start: Harego Lodge, Kombolcha, ETH. 09:30 End: Roha Hotel, Lalibela, ETH. 17:30 Distance Traveled: 310 km Road Conditions: lots of detours, traffic, construction, but for the last 14 km, it was smooth tarmac. Average Speed: 39.9 km/hr Max Speed: 82.8 km/hr Temperature: warm, dry and dusty, drizzle, cool at night

Lalibela's 11 rock-hewn churches are unbelievable. You really have to see it with your own eyes to believe it even exists. Lalibela ranks as one of the world's greatest religious historical sites in the Christian world and has earned a UNESCO Heritage badge. To protect most of the churches from the sun and rain, a scaffolding and roof have been built above them. Not only does this place draw foreign tourists and TV producers worldwide (there is a Canadian team from Quebec here now filming a children's show), Lalibela is the centre of pilgrimage for many Ethiopian Orthodox Christians and during major festivals, this place is swarming. Originally known as Roha (the town was only renamed "Lalibela" after King Lalibela's death), this was the Zagwe dynasty's capital in the 12th and 13th century. There are various legends which explain why these amazing churches were built, all in such close proximity and supposedly within a span of 23 years! One claims that King Lalibela was exiled to Jersusalem in fear of persecution from his older half-brother, and impressed by the buildings he saw, vowed to replicate a "New Jerusalem" when he returned. Another says that the 11 churches were visions that Lalibela saw from God and so felt obliged to recreate them in reality. Whatever the reason, the exceptional architecture and unique characteristics of each church still astounds visitors and historians alike. Mafiz was our guide: 26 year old, a biology teacher by profession but due to the fact that Lalibela residents can make more money by being a tour guide, he decided to go to Tourism College for two years, and after passing his examination, has been working as a qualified Lalibela guide ever since. His wish is to make enough money, get more qualified as a teacher and return to doing what he truly loves. Our day consisted of visiting the 11 amazing medieval churches, going through tunnels and small passageways, admiring the paintings on the walls and ceilings of the churches, paying tribute to each priest in each church (all very serene and calm in their old age), Outside it was hot and dry, but inside the churches there was a cool air mixed with smells of incense and beeswax candles. Our shoe-keeper earned a decent 20 birr from each of us for ensuring our shoes weren't stolen while we were inside the churches. Most of these shoe-minders are high school students (but why aren't they in school?) and all have been registered and wear an official "shoe-keeper" identification card around their necks. There is no way around not employing a shoe-keeper; everyone has to do it. After the tour, we went to pick up Matt's sandals that were being mended in town. A new rubber tire sole had been nailed the the old one and now they were just like new! We wished Mafiz luck in his future, paid him the 300 Birr guiding fee for the day, plus a tip, and went on our way. After a delicious freshly squeezed mango and strawberry juice at the Seven Olives Hotel, we walked back to our hotel, but not without buying a few souvenirs to take home. We haven't actually been buying anything during our journey, but that's due mainly to the fact that we're driving for the better part of the day. We're not actually "tourists" but "Land Rover mechanics on the road" (or so says Christoph). What has been really pleasantly surprising is the minimal hassle from children we've received during our stay in Lalibela. We were warned by other tourists and Overlanders that kids here are everywhere with their hands out and pleading with you to give them pens, Carmella, Highland (bottles), Dollars or money. One Norwegian cyclist had his helmet cracked in half when a big rock was pushed over a ledge by kids as he cycled by on the road underneath! A smile goes a long way anywhere in the world, and it definitely helps that Foxy is so colourful and cheery herself. For the most part, we found Lalibela residents to be very friendly, waving at us, saying "Hello" or "Salam" or "Welcome You to my hometown!" Start: Roha Hotel, Lalibela, ETH. End: Roha Hotel, Lalibela, ETH. Distance Traveled: - Road Conditions: - Temperature: hot, dry

It was a day of memories. Ethiopia seems to be undergoing massive road construction and the majority of them are led by Chinese road crews using local labour. Early in the morning we spotted our first Beijing Jeep, exactly the same kind we used to have when we lived in Urumqi, Xinjiang! We couldn't believe it!! It brought back memories of our beloved Beijing Jeep in Urumqi, the one we did the Taklamakan Rally with! We stopped briefly to talk to one of the Chinese guys who was from Sichuan province, Matt impressing him with his Mandarin. The rest of the day's drive brought back fond memories of our trip to Eritrea about one year ago. The climate, the geography, the people, it was all a warm and familiar deja vu. For those interested, you can read about our adventures in Asmara, Adi Gulti, Keren, Massawa, and with our friendly hosts and tour guides. We recalled how when we were in Eritrea we said how interesting it would be to visit Ethiopia one day. And here we are, one year later, in Ethiopia driving to Bahir Dar on the southern shores of Lake Tana. Life works in wonderfully mysterious ways.

We visited two monastries on Lake Tana this morning. Alice, a Chinese-Canadian girl from Calgary who had just completed a one year CIDA internship with Street Kids International, joined us for the half-day tour. She was backpacking around Ethiopia for a couple of weeks before returning home. Matt and Christoph got to visit a third monastery, but because it was only open to men, we girls just lounged in the boat, waiting, relaxing. Alice was going to Gondar as well so after our tour, followed by a tilapia lunch, we offered to give her a lift in Foxy. It is always fun meeting other travellers, aid workers, or just foreigners in general. The stories which brought them to Africa are normally interesting and quite revealing about their character. Alice asked me if Matt and I had experienced any racism so far during our overland journey for being a mixed-race couple. Her question took me by surprise because we have always considered ourselves to be just 'Bonnie and Matt', nothing more, and certainly nothing different. But of course, from outer appearances, we were obviously quite dissimilar. I had to take a moment to think of an answer, but I told Alice that no, we haven't had any difficulty on our travels. In actual fact, being of different race has provoked curiosity and interest in us instead. We've generally found Africans to be quite forthcoming and will question our relationship, how we met, and how it is possible to marry outside "your tribe." If anything, we have been engaged in conversations we wouldn't have had otherwise if we were from the same country, background, or skin colour. There was no electricity at Belegez Pension, which meant no hot water, which meant no shower. However, there apparently was electricity in some parts of town and desperately needing to get online again, we walked down the hill in search of an internet caf&#xE9;. Since Addis Ababa, we have been trying to make an important online payment to the shipping company in Cape Town so that our stuff will get sent to Vancouver in time. The connection was hopeless though, every time we got the site uploaded, either we couldn't get passed the password stage or the power would cut off. We resigned ourselves to defeat and went in search of food instead. It was around 9pm already so the only place that was serving food was the hippest bar in town. We ate "pasta with tuna and vegetables" (the only quick option on their limited menu) while getting a little shell-shocked at our surroundings. One of the bar's patrons, an Ethiopian born and raised in Boston, was our self-appointed translator. We all found it incredibly strange to see him wearing a flat-capped baseball hat with rapper-style baggy pants and to hear his strong American accent. If you didn't step outside, you could have thought you were in a New York bar. There were disco balls and flashing red lights and an enormous speaker blasting R&#x26;B. Needless to say, we were totally underdressed with our dirty cargo pants and red Gortex rain jackets. There were a few power cuts while we ate, which plunged everyone in complete silence and darkness, and only then were you reminded that you were in Gondar, Ethiopia. Start: Ghion Hotel, Bahir Dar, ETH. 09:08 End: Belegez Pension, Gondar, ETH. 18:00 Distance Traveled: 172 km Road Conditions: good smooth tar road Average Speed: 63.6 km/hr Max Speed: 94.8 km/hr Temperature: cool, pleasant, chilly at night (comparatively)

What a great experience we've had in Ethiopia. We got our Egyptian and Sudanese visas sans problemes in Addis, got Foxy fixed again (AC is definitely busted, no parts available whatsoever), saw Lalibela's impressive rowk-hewn sites, visited the monastries on Lake Tana, travelling by "speed" boat to each island, had a surreal dinner experience last night in one of Gondar's poshest nightclub. Now hoping to have a quick glance-around Gondar's impressive castles and then head straight for the Sudan border. Have been trying desperately to upload more blogs and pictures here, but no luck. Connection is B-A-D, and that's when there is electricity. I am going cold-turkey with this internet thing so when I get home, i think i'll spend a few days straight online relishing the fact that i simply can! We hope to make it to Gedaref in Sudan tonight, if not we'll have to bush camp. It all depends on the road conditions and border formalities, although land mines and bandits aren't uncommon in the area, so we think it best to make it to some sort of 'town' and avoid bushing it tonight. Last we heard, it was 45 Celcius in Khartoum. Yikes. Heat and desert, here we come!

Before we set off at 10 o'clock, Matt drank his last beer for 2 weeks (Sudan has strict laws about no alcohol in the country), while we gave the other 5 to the hotel staff. We will not risk our lives trying to smuggle a few cans of beer into Sudan. We knew this day would come at some point, and anyways, that first beer in Egypt will taste that much better. At least that's what I'm telling Matt. We will have to do with going on a Coca-cola binge for the next two weeks. This morning we tried to find a gas station that sold diesel. There seems to be a national shortage of fuel everywhere and the only place we found some was at NOC station, just outside Gondar town. There was a long queue of trucks and minivan-taxis all waiting to get gas. We were told by the manager that we could skip the queue and fill up at one of the pumps that wasn't allowed to be used. We wondered if this was the pump reserved for emergencies, elite politicians, family members or all of the above. When travelling in Africa, you automatically get special attention for just being slightly 'different'. Sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's good. We obviously got special treatment due to our skin colour and were able to forego the long lineup. To be honest, this was one time where we didn't mind so much; we would've had to wait for hours which would have meant not making it across the border today. Of course, this special treatment for foreigners doesn't bode well for everyone. Trying to get Foxy into a better position for the pump, we collided with a truck that was in line on the other side and who was trying to inch ahead. Our front roll cage got wedged between the truck's and any further movement would have resulted in a very expensive 'fender bender.' In the end, Matt backed up to let the other guy through, but not before letting the truck driver get a piece of his mind. Crossing into Sudan was a tediously long-winded affair. It was pretty straightforward, but there were a lot of forms to fill out, registrations to the police to be made which included a payment of $45 US per person (which we needed to change from US currency first on the black market), Carnet de Passage bureaucracy, passport photos to be given and authenticated, fingerprints taken and finally, a $7 US road tax to be paid and then receipted. All our names at each office had to be translated into Arabic so a lot of time was spent repeating our names slowly and clearly to the official behind the desk. The whole process took about 4 hours. By the time we were finished, it was already 18:30. Not wanting to camp in the police compound, we decided to keep driving for about an hour and then set up bush camp. Coming from Ethiopia, where the people there are lighter-skinned with a more 'European-looking' face (a hint of some Italian mixing from generations ago?), Sudanese people are, in contrast, very dark. It seems the moment you cross into Sudan, the largest country of Africa with 2.5 million sq km, the green rolling hills stop abruptly, and the sandy dusty plains appear. As uninteresting as the stretch of road was, there was a sense of peace and calm, the blazing sun setting in front of us. We all agreed tonight was the worst bush camping experience of our lives. In several words: giant flying cockroaches, deep cracks in soft earth to make falling through them extremely easy, thorny bushes, squirmy scorpions, biting ants, bug-infested pasta meal, relentless heat and humidity, and more of the above-mentionned bugs in our tent. To continue on that bug theme, I've got a whole varied collection of insect bites scattered all over my body. Concentrated around my waist and legs, some quite pussy, some bloody and all extremely itchy. My guess is that a lot of these bites were contracted in Lalibela, where fleas are the predominate predator there. We had some clothes washed at the hotel, and I'm guessing that while they were being hung to dry outside, the pesky little things found their way into my socks and underwear, hence the location of my bites. Oh, the less romantic side of African travel! Start: Belegez Pension, Gondar, ETH. 10:30 End: In the bush at coordinates N 13 14.120' E035 51.368', SUDAN. 18:30 Distance Traveled: 241 km Road Conditions: from horrible to bad to so-so Average Speed: 47.7 km/hr Max Speed: 98.9 km/hr Temperature: cool on plateau and then once we dropped down into Sudan, HOT and sticky.

This morning we woke up to considerably less bugs and insects and most importantly, scorpions. Chiho and Christoph discovered their front tire was flat (a slow leak probably) so while they got busy changing their spare, we pumped up ours to "normal tire pressure" in anticipation for the smooth tar roads today. While filling up with diesel at the Total Gas Station in Gedaref, we met Mergni Mohammed, tall broad and extremely dark. He came right up to us, took our hands with a firm grip and pumped them up and down. The conversation went a little like this: MM: "Oh, welcome to my country!" Us: "Thank you, it is very beautiful." MM: "From where do you come?" Us: "From Canada and England." MM: "Oh, they are rich countries, you are a good match." Us: "Yes, we are lucky." MM: "You have children?" Us: "No, not yet. We want to travel first and then have children later. It is more difficult to travel with children." MM: "But you must have children soon!" Us: "Yes, we will. Your English is very good. Where did you study?" MM: "I have learning English for many years, study hard all self. I want to go abroad to live. I want to convert to Christianity so I leave Sudan and go to rich country." Us: "Oh, uh, well, you don't need to become Christian to go to another country. You can stay Muslim, that's no problem." MM: "No no no, I must change so I have more chance to go to England and Canada." Us: "No, these countries don't need you to change religion." MM: "Hmmm... there is no racism in your country, no? Everyone is friend." Us: "Well, there are many problems with racism in many cities. Not everyone is friendly." MM: "No, I don't believe! What kind of racism?" Us: "Well, sometimes people don't like your skin colour, your religion, your language, your hair colour, the food you eat, how you smell, how you dress, it can be anything!" MM: "No, I still go and I be friends with everyone!" Us: "I hope your dream will come true one day." MM: "Inshallah (God willing)..... can you give me email?" After giving Mergni our email address, we bid him good luck and drove off with our tanks full of cheap Sudanese diesel thinking how fortunate it was to meet someone so engaging and excited to meet us, strangers from faraway lands. He is just one of thousands of Sudanese people dreaming similar dreams that are simple and honest, but for the most part, unanswered. ******** The day's drive was pretty uneventful, except for dodging the speeding trucks and buses. I've realized that straight tar roads aren't necessarily a good thing; they just cause more reckless and inexperienced drivers to travel at outrageous speeds. It's like a video game, but in this version, once it's GAME OVER it really is GAME OVER. The scenery was also pretty uninspiring in terms of diversity and colour. Carcasses of dogs, cows and goats were littered all over the side of the road, all at various stages of decomposition. It was obvious that animals couldn't possibly survive in such harsh conditions with very little food and water in this dry desolate environment. I also noticed there were no humans in sight. What a difference to Ethiopia, where you couldn't go a few hundred metres without seeing several children! As we sped by one rotting carcass after another, their stench invading our nostrils, I wondered: "If animals can't even survive here, how can humans be expected to?" Survival in Sudan. ******** Hot, dusty, incredibly thirsty and sweaty, we arrived at the National Campsite in Khartoum South around dusk. The place is a huge compound with a few dozen portable buildings, numerous ablution blocks, a small shop selling cold drinks and biscuits and a huge outdoor amphitheatre and dusty field. We parked in the field under the trees. The whole place looks like an army compound or the sort of place where the International Olympics Committee would set up a little village for athletes. The shower was hot, can you believe? Not from any sort of heating system, but from the fact that it had been heated all day in the black water tank. Oh, what we would've done for a COLD shower today! For dinner, we walked back up to the junction, a ten minute sweaty stroll, where we ate at a local restaurant while watching Al-Jazeera on television. A beautiful Ethiopian waitress served us chicken kebabs, chicken cooked with onions in a hot sauce, fresh salad (served with cold French fries on top!), and a plate of buttered rice. Everything is garnished with cinnamon and lime, a signature Middle Eastern flavour and very tasty. This restaurant served some fresh blended juices as well, and the mango+milk combination was absolutely divine. Because it was already dark, we hailed a couple of tuktuk's back to the campsite, little motorized rickshaws. We were told that each tuktuk can "only fit two-point-five persons" so we had to get two. It was still very hot and sticky out, probably in the high 30's. There was nothing we could do but try and sleep. Start: Somewhere in the bush, well exactly at N 13 14.120' E035 51.368', SUDAN. 09:30 End: National Campsite, Khartoum, SUDAN. 18:30 Distance Traveled: 521 km Road Conditions: smooth paved highway with manic speeding buses and trucks. Average Speed: 71.8 km/hr Max Speed: 104 km/hr Temperature: 46 degrees Celcius. When driving, it feels like a hot hair-dryer is blowing in your face; whilst idle, it's like being in a sauna.

It's too hot to move today. You shower and the water evaporates before it can even seep into your pores. I'm not even joking, but I wish I were. There were less bugs last night, but with no wind whatsoever it was incredibly stifling in our tent. It is very difficult to get to sleep when you are tossing and turning in your own sweat, trying to avoid minimal contact with your partner, who is also tossing and turning in his own sweat. There is nothing romantic about it at all. ;) After a leisurely breakfast of bread and coffee under the shade of some trees at the campsite, we took a public minibus 400 metres down the road and found refuge in an internet caf&#xE9;. But after an hour of relative fast connection, the power cut off unexpectedly. Everyone got up, paid and exited. We were the only ones left in the dark, packing up our laptops slowly and only until the heat from inside was too unbearable did we step out into the blinding light of day. Hot air gushed onto our faces, a bit like standing inches away from a furnace. We decided the only reasonable thing to do was to go over to the kebab and fruit joint next door (where we had dinner last night) and order some falafel sandwiches and mango shakes. After lunch, we hailed a minivan-taxi, bartered a rate and then took a ride to the North Khartoum Railway Station where we got some information about buying a ferry ticket from Waldi Halfa to Aswan. The only way to cross from Sudan into Egypt (or vice versa) is to take this ferry, which goes only once a week. It is horrendously expensive at 950 Sudanese Pounds ($450 US) per car and 230 SDP ($115 us) for a 1st class cabin for 2 people, but there is no other way if you are determined to do a complete overland journey from Cape Town to London. There are so many overlanders nowadays doing this same journey, either north or south, that when we stepped out of the taxi, there was a man already waiting on the steps. The first thing he said to us was: "You want boat ticket from Wadi Halfa?" Incredible, it's as if the only foreigners he ever sees only come here for this reason. In any case, he greeted us amicably and led us into his small office, where a big fan occupied most of one corner. We found out we can't book a ticket until the start of that particular week you want to travel on so we'll have to come back Tuesday to buy our passenger ticket. And only until we get to Wadi Halfa can we actually book a place for Foxy on the cargo ferry. Passengers are not allowed to travel with their vehicles and anyway, the cargo ferry arrives a day or two later in Aswan. Confident with our newfound knowledge, we taxi'd back to the kebab 'n fruit restaurant where we sweated, read and drank copious amounts of water and fruit juice. Still no internet connection, but the electricity came back on after a few hours. Tonight we cooked up some Thai curry and rice for dinner and between the four of us, polished off 3 big mangoes, a can of pineapple, and a humongous watermelon. While Chiho and I did the cooking and cleaning up, Christoph and Matt were busy getting dirty changing wheel bearings. We looked like a typical traditional family with gender-divided duties but hey, it works! We all agree it's too hot to think, so much so that it actually stunts our judgment and decision making process. We are lethargic and astonished how people here can function on a daily basis. I can just imagine what Sudanese refugees to Canada must feel like during the dead of winter. Matt and I are contemplating going the more direct route to Jersey, via Libya and Tunisia, instead of doing the Middle East and Eastern Europe. It will be hot anywhere we go since it's the height of summer all over, but we would probably save on fuel, hotel rooms (if we decide we simply cannot camp due to the extreme heat), time and most importantly, sanity. It was close to midnight when we climbed into our tent, but the temperature was still incredibly hot. We conducted our tossing-and-turning-in-our-sweat ritual again, and finally fell asleep. Start: National Camping, Khartoum, SUDAN. End: National Camping, Khartoum, SUDAN. Distance Traveled: 0 Road Conditions: - Temperature: 44 degrees Celcius and not a breath of wind. Enough said.

Larium Day. We woke up to a hot sun beating down inside the tent. We have all four windows open but it still feels like sleeping in a hot oven. Still, there was a nice breeze this morning which we were all thankful for. Our fridge stopped working last night; it seems the battery has been totally drained, only after one day! We have two batteries and every time we stop for the night, I switch it to one so not to drain both of them and to eliminate the risk of not being able to start Foxy the next morning. But it is just so hot here the fridge is working overtime. We quickly finished the milk and pineapple chunks for breakfast. The yogurt had to go. Wanting to do a bit of washing before we set off into the desert in a few days, I inquired where we could get our laundry done. The manager took me around the enormous complex and in the back were about a dozen middle-aged men all sitting around huge basins of water washing clothes. This was the first time I had ever encountered men in Africa doing laundry by hand! I was stunned, to say the least. The oldest of the bunch, the one who was probably in charge, made me empty my yellow bucket and plastic bags of clothes. I had to carefully take each one out and lay them on the dirt ground as he counted. He picked everything up from the ground, dropping a few pairs of underwear, scooped them back up and marched to the tap. I tried to imagine this man, dressed in a wide, ankle-length white gown (the common Sudanese outfit for men called a Jalabiya), with strands of greying hair, hunched over his plastic basin scrubbing my underwear and socks. For a traditional and conservative country like Islamic Sudan, this concept was just too funny. He told me, (well the Manager translated for me), that for the 31 pieces of clothing (socks count as 2 items), he will charge me 8 Sudanese Pounds ($4 US) and to come back at 4pm to pick them up. Not bad at all. I said a hearty "Shokran" (thank you) and walked back to the others. On my way, I passed a group of men sharing a meal of beans, cheese, tomato, onion and flat bread. I had said a polite Salam the first time I passed but this time they beckoned me to go over and share their meal. I protested and made motions to my belly to indicate I had just eaten breakfast. Here the men and women eat separately but for foreigners that rule doesn't always apply. They pulled up a white plastic chair and insisted I sit down. I was shoved some bread and told to "Eat Eat! You MUST eat!" A couple of them had decent English so we were able to get the basics across, like where I was from ("Oh do you know Jackie Chan from Hong Kong?"), what I was doing here ("We hope you enjoy our country"), and how hot it was today ("This time of year is the hottest in Sudan, why you travelling now?" Hmph, good question.) For the rest of the morning while I caught up on a bit of blog writing under the shade of the trees, Matt worked on Foxy, changing her front wheel bearings in the intense heat. I have to say I have the much more enjoyable and cool job. We are entertaining the idea of splurging on an air-conditionned hotel room tonight. My only concern is that if we do, I'll only want to sleep in air-con rooms for the rest of the trip, so long as it's hot. ******* This afternoon, I went down to the junction again hoping to get online at the internet caf&#xE9;. Since yesterday's blackout, the entire Sudan Network is down and nobody knows when it'll resume again. So here I am, sitting at the kebab 'n fruit place (again) next door, plugged in and feeling a bit cooler with the breeze of the fans. It is incredibly interesting to be here, watching young adults share a meal, both girls and guys together, chatting animatedly, laughing excitedly, and sending the usual tell-tale flirtatious signs that young people do worldwide. Except here, there is absolutely no physical contact. The only contact I'm observing involves a lot of eye-talk; isn't it amazing what eyes can reveal? The girls are all wearing headscarves and no part of their body is showing except their beautiful face, hands, and for those wearing sandals, feet. Some are wearing make-up, mostly eyeliner, eye-shadow and a bit of lip gloss. They are all elegantly dressed and they all exude an air of absolute confidence in the way they walk, sit, eat. These are the cosmopolitan women of Khartoum, of the whole of Sudan probably, and I love what I see. I am conscious about not wearing sleeveless shirts and shorts here. I am also conscious about how short I am in relation to the people here. Everyone is SO TALL in Sudan, the men especially. I haven't seen one overweight person either, just extremely leggy ones. Start: National Campsite, Khartoum, SUDAN. End: National Campsite, Khartoum, SUDAN. Distance Traveled: - Road Conditions: - Temperature: slight breeze early morning, a lethargic heat all afternoon

Today we went back to get our ferry tickets. We are booked for the Wadi Halfa to Aswan ferry on Wednesday, June 25, 1st class cabin! Although we don't have our hopes up, apparently 2nd class is a single seat and 3rd class is standing room only. And we've got at least 18 hours altogether, so we decided best to get 1st class. We'll see what we get. Afterwards, we got our photography permit at the Travel Bureau downtown. Every tourist must apply for one in order to take pictures in Sudan. And even then, there are strict regulations about what you can photograph. I must resist the urge to just snap whenever and at whatever. After changing some money at the FOREX bureau, we went in search for the Landy Garage to buy some spare parts and to have our back left passenger door fitted with a padlock. We've been having problems with it on and off and needed a permanent fix once and for all. The Landy shop was closed but a guy nearby managed to do a decent job. Car mechanics are such lovely friendly people no matter where you are in the world. It's wonderful. Start: National Campsite, Khartoum, SUDAN. End: World Food Programme guesthouse, Khartoum, SUDAN. Distance Traveled: 0 Road Conditions: - Temperature: like yesterday, and probably what it will be like tomorrow

We caved and booked ourselves into an air-conditioned room. 3 night of camping in 44 degrees heat was enough. I was getting heat rash and Matt was, he claims, seeing little green men in the dashboard. He even forgot to close all the doors on Foxy before climbing into the tent, leaving them wide open for any potential thieves. Luckily Sudan is full of trustworthy and honest people. Instead of spending the usual $5-$10 US per night to camp, we're blowing our budget in one full stroke. Last night we stayed at the World Food Programme/UN guesthouse. A UN staff worker directed us there by chance. This morning the manager told us there was a misunderstanding and only UN staff members were allowed to stay there. So here we are at the lovely locally-run Lisamin Safari Hotel. With no chance of changing traveler's cheques in Sudan and nowhere to use our credit cards, we found one bank (a Lebanese one) in the whole of Khartoum who could do a cash advance on our HSBC VISA. Our backup plan was to get money wired from Western Union from back home. It reminds me of the desperate time while I was living in Ghana when I called home collect because i had run out of money and got my parents to Western Union some over. Luckily we didn't need to resort to that. I've grown up ;) Anyway, we will spend two more nights in our lovely little cool room and depart for Sudan's northern deserts and pyramids on Thursday morning. Start: Lisamin Safari Hotel, Khartoum, SUDAN. End: Lisamin Safari Hotel, Khartoum, SUDAN. Distance Traveled: 0 Road Conditions: - Temperature: hot outside, but nice and COOL in here

Today was a day of administrative duties. We inquired about shipping Foxy from Alexandria in Egypt. It is possible to send it to Venice, Italy, taking about a week to arrive. Not bad. All things considered, especially the time constraint issue, we have decided to forego the Middle East leg of our journey and after shipping Foxy from Alexandria, we'll make our way to Cairo and fly to Milan (which we've booked today for Aug. 10th), and then bus/train it to Venice to pick her up again. We figure it isn't worth rushing through Jordan, Syria and Turkey just because we have a tight schedule. Plus the fact that it will be the middle of summer there, sightseeing will be more of a chore than a pleasure. Now we hope to arrive in Jersey a few days earlier than planned. We'll see. That's the plan. And we of all people know how plans can - and do -change. Start: Lisamin Safari Hotel, Khartoum, SUDAN. End: Lisamin Safari Hotel, Khartoum, SUDAN. Distance Traveled: 0 Road Conditions: - Temperature: well, it looked mighty hot, bright and dusty out there.

The drive was smooth as silk, like skating on a freshly groomed ice rink. In the morning we passed several small desert towns before joining up with the Nile again, where we then saw many oasis towns. The day's drive was only interrupted by numerous police check-points. They all had machine guns mounted on tanks, manned by chubby officers wearing pale blue uniforms and beret hats. For the most part, they only wanted to see our papers and passports. But at some stops, we were asked to pay a 'road fee', legit or not I'm still not too sure but it's best not to argue when the guy holding your passport is carrying an AK-47. The book I'm reading now, The Shackled Continent by journalist Robert Guest, talks a lot about African corruption and one time when he was following a Guinness beer truck deep into the Cameroonian rainforest, at one of the 47 road blocks he and his driver encountered, one gendarme accused the driver of breaking the law of "carrying passengers" and confiscated his driving license. When the pair cried foul and said this law didn't exist, the policeman simply patted his holster and replied "Do you have a gun? No. I have a gun, so I know the rules." Sometimes I'm not sure whether or not authority figures are actually out to lynch money out of travellers, or if I should give them the benefit of the doubt and simply believe that they're actually doing good honest work. It doesn't help matters when language is a major barrier now. My Arabic phrasebook doesn't give me the translation for "If I am going to pay you this supposed road fee, I would like an official receipt in return. Oh and please don't point your rifle at us." It is really a shame that the people you should be able to trust in any society (ie. Police Officers), you have to always second-guess their intention. This is a major thorn in Africa's development. But then you think how useless and corrupt the government is, and if it is unable to provide stable and ample jobs for its citizens, corruption and crime will no doubt come to fruit. You have two choices when you come to a roadblock. You can play Mr./Mrs. Nice Guy/Gal and greet the officer as if you've known him your whole life, shake hands amicably and ask about his health, his family, their health, etc. Calling him 'my friend' and patting him on the back is also a good tactic (although never try this if you are female). After all the formalities are completed, he might just let you off the hook and wish you a "Good Journey". The second option is to play dumb and pretend you have no idea what the officer is saying, although it's blatantly obvious. Keep jabbering in English in a tone that is neither offensive nor accusing, and sooner or later, he will hopefully tire of you and your feigned stupidity and wave you on. So far, these are the two choices we've attempted, both at pretty successful rates. But the key is to pick one and stick to it BEFORE your car is stopped and you're face to face with him and his gun. Of course there are other factors that come into play, like if there are more than two officers at a road block. If that's the case, then it's best to play nice because making buddies is far easier with a group of these guys than trying to weasel your way out of a bribe, causing them to lose face in front of each other. The whole thing is a game, a sort of battle of the egos if you will. I wonder how the rules would change if it were female officers manning the road blocks. I'm not sure, but I think I would be more frightened by a beefy Sudanese woman caressing her AK-47, eyeing us suspiciously. ~~~~~ We arrived in Merowe around mid-afternoon and crossed the double-laned (amazing!) bridge across to Kerima town. Jebel Barkal, a World Heritage Site, is the Kerima's main draw. South of the main street, this mountain was sacred ground for the Egyptians at the time of the 18th-dynasty Pharaohs. There are some well-preserved pyramids and a temple around it. There was a museum as well but we didn't go in. We wanted to camp at the Nubian Rest-House, reportedly the best (and most expensive) option in town, but it was closed during the low season of April to October. So option two was checking out the "best lokanda in town", (lokanda is the local word for basic lodging), the Al Nasser. After a quick peek we decided it was in our best interest to bush camp instead. We met up with C+C again (they left Khartoum a day earlier and took the longer route to Kerima via the Merowe pyramids), went for dinner and after watching the Germany vs. Portugal quarter-final match, we drove out to the foothills of Jebel Barkal Mountain to set up camp. After taking a nice bucket shower under the twinkling stars and (almost) full moon, we went to sleep peacefully. There were, of course, the village dogs serenading us all night long, but it has now become such an expected part of our night time slumber, I wonder if I'll miss it. Start: Lisamin Safari Hotel, Khartoum, SUDAN. 10:30 End: Bush Camp at foothills of Jebel Barkal Mountain, Kerima, SUDAN. 16:30 Distance Traveled: 444 km Road Conditions: smooth beautiful painted tarmac road Average Speed: 74.9 km/hr Max Speed: 108 km/hr Temperature: hot all around, mid 40's at least

Anytime we utter a statement or a simple wish like "I hope there's satellite TV in (insert village name) so we can watch the European Championship match tonight" or "We made it to (insert village name) in one piece and we didn't have to drive in the dark".. people always respond with a "Thanks be to God!" Today was a "Thanks be to God" day if there ever was one. The day started off well. We even helped a broken-down minibus full of very tall and very burly Sudanese men headed for Dongola. It seems the further away we get from Khartoum, the larger the people become. I'm dumbfounded as to why. Anyway, there were about a dozen of these guys waiting on the side of the road in the midday heat with no water, no food, and a flat tire. Although they had a spare tire with them, nobody checked to see before leaving if it would fit the rim of the van (which it didn't). We told them we could take someone the rest of the way (less than 100 km) so they could mend their tire and hitch a ride back. Just as one of the fattest men was about to climb into Foxy, we joked that we could only take the smallest man due to limited space, using lots of hand gestures to emphasize our point. They thought that was hilarious but we were quite serious. In the end, a young teenager and his kid brother (?) managed to squeeze in the back. Before heading off, we gave the men water, bread and biscuits. After being showered with many well wishes like "May God bless you for always and with lots of children", we drove off. After that, our luck dropped substantially. After driving all day over tar, gravel, sand, dirt and rocks, we stopped around 4pm to take a look at some rock carvings next to the 3rd cataract near the Nile. As we waited for C+C to catch up, we realized the clutch stopped engaging and so changing gears was now impossible. Christoph hypothesized that the little rubber ring which creates a seal for the fluid must have melted in the Sudanese heat and was not sealing properly anymore. We stopped, took a look underneath and to our horror, saw two more problems to add to our misery: the front prop shaft had blown AND the suspension was finished. St. Christopher is the patron for safe travel, and it couldn't apply more than to our friend Christoph. He told us, in his usual optimistic way, that he had just that exact rubber for the clutch, a brand new suspension we could put in and as long as we made it to Wadi Halfa tomorrow, we could drive without the prop shaft, as if it were a 2-wheel drive car. So after starting Foxy up again, in 2nd gear this time (so there wouldn't be a need to change gears), we went in search of a flat piece of ground to bush camp. I can't begin to express how lucky we are to be travelling with Christoph and Chiho. Not only have they become good friends, but they are like our "recovery and spare parts vehicle". It embarrasses us how unprepared we are, and we don't know what to say or do to repay them. In the end, with a little creative engineering, a new rubber ring was inserted, the shock replaced and the prop shaft removed. We prayed we would be able to get to Wadi Halfa by tomorrow, where there may be some hope of finding a mechanic. Matt experienced his lowest point of the trip so far today. After a hot day's drive with no reward of a shower or cold beer, no one wants to then get under the car and strip her apart to diagnose a broken clutch, prop shaft and suspension, all the while getting soaked in brake fluid. But he and Christoph (who has a cold and sore throat on top of it all) did, and I'm grateful for it. Start: Bush Camp at foothills of Jebel Barkal Mountain, Kerima, SUDAN. 10:00 End: Bush Camp at N19 57.056' E030 34.015', SUDAN. 16:30 Distance Traveled: 280 km Road Conditions: smooth tarmac from Kerima to Dongola, and then rough dirt tracks. Average Speed: 61.7 km/hr Max Speed: 107 km/hr Temperature: getting a bit repetitive, but i've run out of words to describe "HOT"

<!-- ENTRY BODY -->
It wasn't the grand entrance we were hoping for when we arrived in Wadi Halfa, but we made it. I could've kissed the ground. We made an early start this morning, just in case. We started Foxy up, held our breath, and lo and behold, the quick fix with the rubber ring worked! A miracle! But as the day wore on, our clutch wore out and we had to drive the 300+ km without stopping all the way in 3rd gear. For cold drinks, I had to climb all over our stuff to reach the fridge in the back. For bathroom stops, we had to go without. We arrived in mid-afternoon, sought refuge in a restaurant with cold mango juices and then went off into the desert to search for a nice bush camp. Today is a holiday (Friday and Saturday being the Islamic weekend) so tomorrow we will inquire about the ferry and try to find a mechanic. Start: Bush Camp at N19 57.056' E030 34.015', SUDAN. 08:30 End: Bush Camp at N21 45.997' E031 22.269', Wadi Halfa, SUDAN. 14:30 Distance Traveled: 318 km Road Conditions: sand, dirt, rough tracks, narrow alleyways in villages Average Speed: 45.5 km/hr Max Speed: 75.5 km/hr Temperature: Today is the summer Solstice and we are right on the Tropic of Cancer (well, we'll pass it on the ferry en route to Aswan, but it's close enough), which means we are at the hottest possible place during the hottest possible time in the year. What luck!

<b>Wadi Halfa, Sudan</b>

<!-- ENTRY HEADER ENDS -->

<!-- ENTRY BODY -->
Wadi Halfa was founded by a few Nubian families from the original Halfa who resisted the government's forced relocation. It exists today solely on the fact that it is the jumping point to Egypt via ferry. The southern part of Egypt (mainly from the Sudan border to Aswan) is a restricted area and so you must take the passenger ferry and your car must be loaded onto the cargo ship in order to cross into Egypt. One man in Khartoum told us we could go along the Red Sea coast, from Port Sudan up to the Egyptian border, but you need special permission to travel those roads and we've never heard any overlanders attempt this route successfully before. Sometimes, it is best to stay on the road most travelled. Having already purchased our passenger ferry in Khartoum, this morning we sorted out a cargo ticket for Foxy. Magdi Boshara, the local agent for booking both ferry and cargo tickets with the Nile Navigation Company, was a great help. Knowledgeable, competent and fluent in English, he is the man to see for getting all your documents ready and he is famous amongst all overlanders. We explained to him our car situation. Due to Foxy's broken clutch, it was imperative that we drive her onto the cargo ferry. We didn't trust anybody else to do it. Magdi was very understanding and made arrangements with another ship to take us on Tuesday. Our passenger ferry doesn't leave until Wednesday and because the cargo ship takes 2 days to go up to Aswan, this meant both us and Foxy would arrive on the same day: Thursday. Perfect. With most of our paperwork finished, the security officer came to Magdi's office to check our passports and register us into Wadi Halfa's records. While sitting under the whirling ceiling fan in the office, they asked us why so many foreigners come to Wadi Halfa but instead of choosing to stay in one of the local hotels, prefer to camp in the desert. We said that in Europe and North America we don't have such an opportunity to camp in the desert and so we like to do that here. Basically, it's a novelty. He nodded his head but I'm not sure he fully understood why anyone would CHOOSE to sleep "like dogs do." Although I prefer the solitude and beauty of the desert, plus the fact that you have your own pick of the perfect (non-smelly) 'toilet', with Foxy as 'sick' as she is and Matt wanting a room with some sort of cooling device (a fan, no air-con in this town), we moved into the Deffintoad Hotel in town. We first checked several places out, but they were all pretty much the same. For a mere 7 Sudanese Pounds per person ($3.50 US) per night, you get a graffiti-walled room with a prison-like iron door that doesn't open or close properly, a string bed (I refused to use the stained foam mattress for fear of more fleas and bed bugs), access to muddy water and a smelly squat latrine. "A bit much for a tin shack with sand floors and buckets of dirty lake water for washing in" says our rather honest guidebook, but it will have to do. What clinched the deal for us was the ceiling fan; you simply can't put a price on that. For Wadi Halfa, this is the equivalent of The Sheraton. ~~~~~~ It seems from about 10am to about 6pm, people go into hibernation mode and the streets are completely deserted like some haunted ghost town. But right after evening prayer, the town comes alive and everyone comes out in droves. Tables and chairs are set up in front of restaurants, the televisions are plugged in and you can hear a cacophony of Arabic soaps and Hindi music videos from every street corner. We watched Italy play Spain in the quarter-finals of the Euro 2008 while munching on falafels and sipping fresh mango juice with dodgy Nile ice cubes. While Matt watched the second half of the game (which eventually went into overtime and then penalty shots, with Spain proving victorious), I went on a manic cleaning fit, scrubbing out the fridge and washing our dirt-and-oil-stained clothes. It is much better to do these sorts of things at night without the midday heat, even if it means draining your torch batteries. Tomorrow we must try and find Mustafah, Magdi's cousin, who is reportedly the town's best mechanic. Start: Bush Camp at N21 45.997' E031 22.269', Wadi Halfa, SUDAN. End: Deffintoad Hotel, Wadi Halfa, SUDAN. Distance Traveled: 0 Road Conditions: - Temperature: 40+ degrees with a perfectly cloudless sky

This morning after a quick shower I walked out of our hotel to the closest tea vendor stall and ordered a "qahwa turkuyq" (Turkish coffee). Served in a tiny glass cup, it was strong, sugary and spiked with cardamom and cinnamon; exactly what I needed to start another hot day. The electricity is not as intermittent as in Ethiopia, thank goodness, but we were warned it goes off every night from 1am - 4am, which means our ceiling fan stops. We thought we could bear it and we did, just. Even with the extreme stuffy conditions in our concrete room, it is nice to have a 'home base' for a couple of days and not one where we have to put up and take down every time we want to drive around. Not that we could do that either. Foxy was still in dire need of some special TLC and our mission today was to find someone who could fix her, temporarily if not permanently. Just enough so we can get to Egypt, where there are more spare parts and mechanics available. ~~~~ Like yesterday, we ate lunch at the police station canteen. Not the most inviting of environments, but it has ceiling fans and a television. We ordered fuul (stewed brown beans) and cheese sandwiches, and freshly squeezed lime and lemon juice. Yum. A few of the police officers came over and plopped themselves on plastic chairs around us. It seems 'police duty' in Wadi Halfa equals eating falafel sandwiches, chewing quat, and watching Bollywood movies starring scantily clad Indian actresses with (I noticed) big hungry eyes. Stereotypes aside, they were friendly. They asked us why we didn't have children yet after having being married for almost three years. They all had an average of 5 kids each. When we explained to them our reasons, they would have none of that and retorted: "You must go now and start a family because you don't know when you will die and you must make sure your name lives." It's hard to know what to say to that, so we promised them that we would try harder. ~~~~ Well, turns out miracles do happen in small Sudanese port towns. Mustafah the mechanic, Magdi's cousin, had a Land Rover Defender slave cylinder that, with a little push and shove, fit just nicely into Foxy's gear box. "Thanks be to God" we had a functioning clutch again! After paying him 140 SPD (a real bargain, including parts and labour), Mustafah asked Matt when we would be coming back down to Sudan. Although we have no immediate plans to do the same overland route from North to South, Matt told him maybe in 5 or 10 years' time. This caused quite an excitement in Mustafah who said: "Don't forget about your friend, Mustafah in Wadi Halfa who will be waiting for you to bring him Polish Vodka." He whispered the last two words. Apparently he had a friend from Poland who managed to smuggle in some of this Polish vodka over the border, and for someone who's probably never tasted many alcoholic drinks in his lifetime, fell in love with it. Start: Deffintoad Hotel, Wadi Halfa, SUDAN. End: Deffintoad Hotel, Wadi Halfa, SUDAN. Distance Traveled: 0 Road Conditions: - Temperature: burning heat

This morning we were at Magdi's office bright and early with our cars, ready to drive them onto the cargo ship bound for Aswan. But first, we had to wait until the hundreds of bags of limestone were unloaded. The entire crew of the cargo ferry consisted of four Egyptian men. There's your typical captain (big bellied, short and stout), his right-hand-man (tall, slim, chain-smoking, and weather-faced), and two others. While they unloaded, there was nothing we could do but wait and wait. Seven hot hours later Foxy was allowed on board. But in the end I never even got to see Foxy being loaded onto the ship. Christoph drove his Landy on first, carefully negotiating the two wooden planks onto the platform, and just when I was secretly trying to snap a picture, camera inside my bag, covered with another bag, the Man In Charge saw me and scolded me right away. He waved his clipboard around aggressively, screaming "NO PICTURES!! NO PICTURES" in my face. It's all very sensitive as to what you can photograph in Sudan, even with our 'official' photography permits. When we asked earlier on, Magdi had told us we could take a quick shot of the cars if we wanted to, but to try and be discreet. Today wasn't my lucky day. Mr. Man In Charge made me zip up my bag, finger and clipboard still wagging in my face, him still continuously chanting at full volume: "NO PICTURES!! NO PICTURES!!" At this point, Chiho came over with her mammoth camera and lens around her shoulder, somewhat shielded by her scarf. She had managed to snap a few pictures of Christoph and the car, but at that moment, Mr. Man In Charge, now all red in the face, saw her camera and lunged for it. A tug-of-war with Chiho's expensive camera ensued between us and him, who had now changed his mantra to a furious "GIVE ME FILM!! GIVE ME FILM!!" Eventually another guy stepped in and shooed us away down the pier. I stuffed Chiho's camera in my bag and we walked back to the waiting lounge about 500 metres away. Only then were we safe. So I never got to say a proper goodbye to Foxy. ~~~ We found out just how lucky we were this afternoon. Usually there is a cargo ferry once a week that can ship cars to Aswan, but this week there wasn't going to be one for whatever reason. If we hadn't put our cars onto this cargo ship, that normally doesn't take cargo back up Lake Nasser, we would've had to wait another week or so. Considering our tight schedule (both ours and C+C's), we were very fortunate to have found these guys willing to take our two Landy's with them back up to Aswan. Lucky lucky us. ~~~ Tonight we met a friendly Korean missionary family, stationed in Khartoum, but on a four-week holiday with their three adorable little boys. They were making their way north by public transport to some of the Nubian villages in northern Sudan and then to Egypt to see Luxor and finally to swim in the Red Sea. The boys attend the International School in Khartoum, and besides learning Arabic at school, conversing in Korean at home, they speak perfect American-accented English. Confident, curious, clever and extremely direct, we even got the "Why don't you have children yet?" accusation from them just minutes after meeting! We found out from them (on our last day of course!) that Sudanese people have breakfast around noon, lunch at 5pm and dinner at 10pm. This totally explains why whenever we go for "dinner" (at around 6 or 7), everyone always says "Food finish" or "Not yet". We always got a plate of something, usually fuul, falafels and bread, but nobody ever told us the normal time to eat around here, and we never thought to ask! ~~~ Tomorrow we leave this port town and head north to Egypt. We are ready. This ferry trip is like the pinnacle of our journey; once we have surpassed it, the rest should be relatively easy, inshallah (God willing). Having been in Wadi Halfa for a few days now, I'm beginning to discover its hidden charms. It was originally built in front of the railway station, but somebody made some major mistakes in calculating the tides and the entire town was washed away one year. Today there are make-shift buildings and shacks dotted around this old port town. All of our guidebooks only have negative comments to say about this place: dusty, desolate and completely dependent on the business of the weekly ferry that brings passengers to and from Aswan in Egypt. But there is character, and if it weren't for the excruciating heat, life is easy and simple. Still, we are looking forward to our ferry trip tomorrow to transport us to luxurious Aswan where "ATM's spew money, scantily-clad tourists offend the locals and Stella beer is freely available." Our cabin is reportedly air-conditioned too! We already have a plan to board the ferry as soon as possible, buy copious amounts of beer (there are 9 South African overlanders, 6 Dutch backpackers, 2 Spanish bikers and 1 British backpacker besides us so we need to make a mad dash), lock the door and celebrate crossing into our 13th country in cool cabin comfort. Start: Deffintoad Hotel, Wadi Halfa, SUDAN. End: Deffintoad Hotel, Wadi Halfa, SUDAN. Distance Traveled: 0 Road Conditions: - Temperature: hot of course *Apologies for the lack of pictures. Am now super paranoid about taking any shots here.

Last night we slept with the other Wadi Halfan residents outside under the bright stars and fluorescent mosque lights, and believe it or not, we were cold! We couldn't stand the heat and stuffiness of our room anymore and decided to partake in this nightly slumber party outside where everyone drags their string bed into the sandy lot and claims their spot. Sheets and pillows are brought out and after an evening wash, we all climb into bed en masse. The wind provided a cool breeze all night (no chance of that shutting off between 1-4am) and after all the outdoor tea shops and television stations were closed down, all you could hear were the dogs barking and the sound of the occasional motor-trike zooming by. It was so pleasant. Why didn't we do this two nights ago? We arrived at the ferry pier around noon and waited in the lounge with everyone else. There were well over 500 people already and it was incredible to see so many women and children again after days of only interacting with men. While men spend most of their time in public with other men, women live very private lives indoors. It was refreshing to see so much colour and movement once more. After our passports and exit papers were stamped, we boarded the ferry feeling a bit like cattle being herded. We found our cabin (Number Two) and waited some more. It was 3pm already but only after another two hours did we finally set sail. There was no beer to speak of. We should've known it was too good to be true. Well, if you've already abstained for two weeks, what's another day? Counting our blessings, at least the air-conditioner rumour proved to be true. Plus it was functioning! I am happy, content. I catch myself letting out a big sigh of relief a few times each day. We are in SUDAN, imagine that! I wake up every morning and the first thing that flashes in my mind is "What country am I in? What city?" I have to remind myself sometimes that I am truly fortunate to be on a once-in-a-lifetime trip like this one, and some heat, dust and smelly ablutions won't scar me forever. The saying goes "The grass is usually greener on the other side", but I like my pastures just fine over here, thank you. Start: Deffintoad Hotel, Wadi Halfa, SUDAN. End: somewhere on Lake Nasser, EGYPT. Distance Traveled: guessing 50 km or so on Lake Nasser, northwards Road Conditions: calm waters Temperature: hot and sticky outside; chilly in room with our air-con with one setting (ON or OFF) but no complaints

Coming into Aswan this morning we passed some pyramids, a Monument to Soviet-Egyptian Cooperation, and then sitting tall and proud on the cargo ship in the pier was FOXY! We were so relieved. It was 10am but we still had to wait another 5 hours before being allowed to disembark. All the passports had to be inspected, stamped and recorded by Egyptian Immigrations. You had to line up and give in your passport in, have the officer ensure you were the one in the passport, go back to your cabin and wait, and then hours later, listen for your name to be called on the loudspeaker so you can collect your passport again. What a tedious affair and they do this every week! Little did we know, this was an introduction to all the bureaucracy we were going to face in the next few days. Surprisingly enough, getting our Landy's off the cargo ship was fairly simple. We got things going by slipping a bit of baksheesh (bribe/tip) to the Customs Officer later. Actually there was no choice in the matter; the cars were already off and we were told we had to pay up. We couldn't actually drive the cars though since we hadn't yet processed the papers, gotten our Egyptian license plates, registered at the police station, bought insurance or received Egyptian driver's license. These procedures are mandatory for all foreign-registered vehicles. Again, there is no way around it. It was just the beginning of the weekend, so we left the cars in the parking lot and took a taxi to our hotel, The Nubian Oasis Hotel. After dumping our bags, we went out in search for food, our first meal of the day. We ate at Chief Kalil, a cozy little restaurant famous for its seafood. This was a monumental moment to be sitting in Aswan, drinking sweet lime juice (still no beer to be found - yet!) and munching on fish bones. The 'easy' part of the journey was finished and now all we had to do was go north to Alexandria on paved roads. And if anything did go wrong, a garage or service station was always nearby. And here in the land of sly business men, we at least understood and could partake in the common language: baksheesh. Start: Nile Navigation passenger ferry, cabin 2, on Lake Nasser, EGYPT. End: Nubian Oasis Hotel, Aswan, EGYPT. Distance Traveled: 0 Road Conditions: - Temperature: hey is it me or does it feel cooler in Aswan?

Is it wrong to assume that if I want to buy a can of Coke, I would just hand over some money, get the drink, be given change (depending on if the exact amount was given or not), and be done with the transaction? Apparently it is in Egypt. Here, you must bargain for even the basics like food and water. It's ridiculous. One usually expects a set price when you buy a loaf of bread or a bottle of 350 ml water. Not here. You have to fight and argue your way to a fair price. We're already fed up. Many overlanders rant and rave about how great Sudan is, how friendly and honest the locals are (I'm not including the police here), and how there is little begging and harassment. I now see their point. Coming from touristy Egypt and then going into Ethiopia, where begging by children is 'normal', Sudan does seems like paradise. So we tried to avoid the hoards of incessant hawkers by staying in, reading and sleeping. But for meals we had to go out and face the fight. For lunch we decided to go to Biti Pizza in the piazza. It was closeby and it reportedly "serves up Egyptian and Italian-style pizzas in refreshingly clean surrounds." Sounds good. But our guidebook didn't mention the outrageous inflated prices for foreigners. Not only do non-Arabic speaking customers get a separate menu (where no matter what pizza you order it is a set 35 EGP), they don't even let you see the Arabic menu to compare prices. Chiho memorized the numbers in Arabic so we wanted to find out just how much more we were expected to pay. For dinner we tried a local place that served up some delicious camel stew and shish-kebab. The manager was upfront about "foreigner prices" and told us they charge an extra 1 EGP per person, no more. What honesty! I don't mind paying a bit more if I know in advance what it is and as long as I don't have to bargain for it. I swear the meal was tastier because we were all in a better mood. Strolling back through the piazza to our hotel, we got the usual touts and hollers. You just have to put on a Don't-Talk-To-Me face and keep walking. The moment your eyes start to wander on all their colourful paraphernalia, it's too late. Expect the following to be shouted at in your face: "Come my lady, looking is for free!" "Hey China China China!" (only if you're Asian-looking) "Hey Japan Japan Japan!" (again, only if you're Asian-looking) "You, postcards for cheap!" "Come here, no hassle in my castle!" And my favourite, if I had to choose one: "I don't know what you're looking for but I have it." Start: Nile Nubian Oasis Hotel, Aswan, EGYPT. End: Nubian Oasis Hotel, Aswan, EGYPT. Distance Traveled: 0 Road Conditions: - Temperature: 42 degrees can actually feel cool after days of 46 degrees.

During our overland journey, I've been reading about travel writer Paul Theroux's overland adventures from Cairo to Cape Town in his Dark Star Safari. Visiting the same countries as him, although he saw Mozambique and Zimbabwe whereas we went through Namibia and Botswana, he traveled mainly by public transport and stayed in local hotels. Most of the book's chapters are divided into countries, so I read it backwards, reading only the chapter that was relevant to our trip at that time. I'm at the Egypt chapter, the first African country Theroux encounters and my last. I find myself laughing out loud at his vivid descriptions of what life is like as a tourist or passer-by in this ancient land. Regarding Aswan, he paints an accurate portrait of the "persistent, nagging, stalking" curio-sellers in a "good-natured bazaar, divided in half - local people buying melons and grapes and fava beans and coffee and spices, and tourists haggling over plaster images of the pyramids and the Sphinx, and Nefertiti, brassware depicting King Tut's shiny face and colourful carpets, walking sticks and T-shirts." I couldn't have described it any better. ~~ This morning our taxi driver, Kamal, picked us all up at 8:30 on the dot to take us to the police station to get our car insurance, Egyptian license plate and license, and to obtain other necessary official car documents that needed to be stamped and verified. We have resigned ourselves to all this bureaucracy and don't bother to ask what or why anymore. Yesterday, when Kamal took Matt and Christoph to get the cars registered, they were two minutes late coming downstairs from the hotel and Kamal made it a point to tell them off. Now when an Egyptian gets angry, be it man or woman, they can really scream and yell like you wouldn't believe. It's a bit scary actually. So we made sure we were ready and waiting by the curb when he arrived today. It's rather interesting to notice that, so far, Egyptians are quite the sticklers when it comes to keeping time. What happened to "African time?" Is this a product of a productive and consumerist society, or is it simply their character? We arrived at the police station by 9 o'clock but we were too early. Apparently the "man with the stamp" was either busy, not there or asleep. Nobody could really speak English and tell us which it was. But it didn't matter. All we could do was practice what we have become extremely good at doing: waiting. ~~ Convoys must be adhered to, we are told, to protect foreigners. It was during the Luxor massacre in 1997, that Islamic fanatics suddenly opened fire on some tourists at a temple, killing 63 people. We later visited this temple, Hatshepsut Temple. A few years ago, six German tourists were taken hostage but were fortunately released after a week. Also, there have been bomb explosions at Sinai and Sharm el-Sheikh. And the list goes on. So these police-escorted convoys between cities have been enforced. All tourists, no matter if you are traveling independently or in a packaged-tour, must move together, sandwiched by dozens of siren-blaring cars carrying machine gun-touting officers. From Luxor to Aswan alone, there are nine checkpoints and it is impossible to get through if you are not in convoy. After all our procedures were completed at the police station, we made a quick stop at the Aswan High Dam and then headed to the starting point of the 2pm convoy to Luxor. We didn't have time to grab some lunch but at the start of the convoy was a little shop selling snacks and drinks. We went in, saw that all the drinks had prices marked underneath them on the shelves which we were relieved about (no bargaining!), grabbed some cold Cokes and water and got out our wallets to pay. Immediately, the shop-keeping told us that the price was converted to dollars for foreigners so it would actually cost us about 10 EGP for each drink, five times the amount that was marked. This was outrageous! Bargaining for something that doesn't have a fixed price is one thing, but this guy was trying to blatantly cheat us when the listed price was there for everyone to see. Matt decided to try the tough-guy approach (based on Christoph's theory that it's sometimes a normal part of Egyptian dealings), which basically meant some nose-to-nose confrontation and raised voices. Eventually we got the listed price, but having to expend that much energy for cold drinks, especially ones that were already price-marked, is just not right. ~~ Four hours later, when we arrived at Rezeiky Camp, the only camping option in Luxor, we found out that the camping fee was more expensive than staying at the Nubian Oasis Hotel in Aswan. We were not willing to pay this rate and told the man on duty we needed to negotiate a price with the Manager now or else we go looking elsewhere. It was after 5pm and we didn't want to drive around Luxor in the dark. The man told us the Manager was asleep at home and could we please wait an hour, have a drink or something, until he comes. We couldn't believe it, this was the second time today we were told somebody we wanted to see was asleep! I didn't believe it the first time I heard it and I certainly didn't believe it now. I was not in a good mood. For some reason, I get the feeling that not many people here are helpful unless they know they can personally gain in some way. They would rather give you some lame nonsense excuses before admitting they didn't know something. It's only been a few days, but all of us are drained from having to constantly face this "I'm going to rip you off because I can" attitude. What could we do but wait? While the others sat at a table, I went exploring and met another guest in their 'internet caf&#xE9;' (dark and dingy room with 3 old PC's and some broken chairs) who happened to be good family friends with the Manager and the camp's supplier of Stella Beer and Heineken. I explained to him our situation and how we needed to confirm a reasonable camping fee or else we would head elsewhere. He immediately called up his manager-friend on his mobile, who was most definitely NOT asleep, and passed him to me. In the end, we bargained a fairly decent price, including free breakfast, and after a quick shower, went out to search for dinner. We found the Metropolitan Restaurant after a 20 minute walk, right on the banks of the Nile River. Although the food was rather expensive, they did have a wide-screen TV and satellite reception, which made our decision about where to watch the Germany vs. Spain final of the Euro 2008 very easy. Too bad for Christoph (and us, and all Germans) the Germans lost. Start: Nile Nubian Oasis Hotel, Aswan, EGYPT. 14:00 End: Rezeiky Camp, Luxor, EGYPT. 17:30 Distance Traveled: 234 km Road Conditions: in convoy on good paved roads Average Speed: 60.0 km/hr Max Speed: 95.9 km/hr Temperature: low 40's but pleasant

No one can come to Luxor and not visit the Valley of the Kings. This ancient city is built on and around the 4000 year old site of ancient Thabes. No where else in Egypt can you find such a concentration of monuments, temples and historic sites. It is truly staggering. The village of Thebes became the leading centralized powerhouse at the end of the Old Kingdom period under the 11th and 12th dynasty pharaohs, from 1550 to 1069 BC. First named the Gates of the Kings and the Place of Truth, the Valley of the Kings consist of more than sixty tombs. Although only a select few are open for public viewing, we decided to see the 'top three' tombs due to our budget (you must pay for every tomb you enter). Yusuf, our 26 year old guide, was very knowledgeable and patient. We were all quite bothered by the intense heat but he kept his cool and explained everything over and over again with a smile. Our first stop was at the Colossi of Memnon, two 18 m-high statues, one of which was carved from a single piece of rock. The Greeks believed that these statues were of Memnon, who was killed by Achilles in the Trojan War. We then saw Ramses Tombs IV, I and III, followed by Hatshepsut's Tomb. Tombs and temples aside, the hordes of tourists were just as interesting to look at. After returning to Rezeiky Camp, we had a late lunch and a swim in the pool. Due to the multiple flea bites I received last night (again!), I decided that it was time to take out our DOOM can and completely spray the inside of our tent along with the mattress on both sides. Up until now I've been reluctant to use the DOOM, not wanting to breathe in the chemicals while we sleep. But these fleas are becoming my sworn enemies. ~~ After a lot of thought and debate, we finally decided that we will head east tomorrow towards the Eastern Desert and the Red Sea. Chiho and Christoph are planning on doing the Western Desert route so we will part ways with them tomorrow. Not wanting to face the hawkers and touts outside the gates, we opted to stay at Rezeiky Camp for our last meal together. Prepared by two women (interestingly enough a first for us in Egypt since most cooks in restaurants are male), we feasted on an authentic home-cooked Egyptian meal of beef stew, okra and garlic, kofta (Egyptian spiced sausages), rice, pita, salad and humus. It was unexpectedly one of the best meals of our trip so far. It has been a pleasure traveling with C+C all these weeks, BBQ'ing lamb chops in the Ethiopian highlands and cooking Japanese curry in the Nubian desert, swimming in soapy Lake Turkana and getting 'detained' by the Kenyan Police, experiencing the richness of Africa's churches, temples and markets, and of course cheering Germany on in the Euro 2008 in a variety of venues - and then sharing their loss in the Finals. Thank you both for everything. Especially for your spare shock absorber, spare bushes, spare rubber clutch ring, assortment of tools and wealth of car repair knowledge. You are the prime reason why we have gotten to Luxor today. To follow their journey, visit Chiho's blog, and Christoph's blog. Start: Rezeiky Camp, Luxor, EGYPT. End: Rezeiky Camp, Luxor, EGYPT Distance Traveled: - Road Conditions: - Temperature: the kind of heat that makes sight-seeing unfortunately quite uncomfortable

Enough was enough. It seems our tent mattress has become the prime nesting spot for hundreds, if not thousands, of fleas. Last night was hotter than the previous night, and it seems the DOOM spray didn't quite do its job. I now have a few dozen more bites all over my body, and since we were both up all night, me scratching and Matt sweating, we are more sleep-deprived than ever. So here we are, resigned, albeit not so reluctantly, to Room #319 at the Sea Star Beau Rivage Hotel in resort-studded Hurghada. There are lots of very pink Europeans here! It was the first place we inquired about (the suggested hotel in our guidebook was fully booked) but we really couldn't be bothered to look anymore, having already driven 5+ hours straight in police convoy from Luxor this morning. We dropped off our bags, showered and headed to the dining area for the buffet lunch. Spread along multiple tables was an incredible selection of food that could literally feed hundreds - I wondered how much of it went uneaten and was then thrown into the garbage bins. Unlimited access to rich food and alcoholic drink is not always ideal when your stomach has become accustomed to simple meals like fuul and pita bread and mint tea. And so, when we were back in our room after having just greedily consumed more calories than necessary, it was no surprise we (unintentionally) fell asleep for 5 hours. Here in the hotel, there are activities that include water aerobics, disco parties, beach volleyball, and evening entertainment. Watermelons and pineapples are carved into intricate flowers and designs, all simply for viewing pleasure. Managers and waiters call you "Ma'am" and "Sir", and using "May I" and "Please" is considered the norm. This resort-style vacation is like another world altogether. I don't think I'm quite ready for it yet, but I will take the comfortable flea-free bed and reliable hot water shower. Before dinner (yet another unbelievable smorgasbord of Egyptian, Italian, Asian and Mexican cuisine), we took a stroll past the hotel's TWO swimming pools (including a pool bar) and to the private beachfront. One of the main reasons why we chose to come to the Red Sea was to do some scuba diving, rated as one of the best coral diving spots in the world. Based in the hotel was the Twin Divers company and so we booked ourselves a full day's diving excursion with them tomorrow, a generous gift from Sue and Guy - thank you! * Happy Canada Day everyone! Start: Rezeiky Camp, Luxor, EGYPT. 08:00 End: Sea Star Beau Rivage, Hurghada, EGYPT. 13:00 Distance Traveled: 292 km Road Conditions: in convoy on good roads Average Speed: 67 km/hr Max Speed: 111 km/hr Temperature: 39 Celcius, says BBC World Weather, with a relative humidity of 20%

The last time we went diving was in the Philippines over a year ago. It was great to be exploring the underwater world again. Today, we did two reef dives. Jacques, from Monaco, was our dive leader. Our second dive, in the afternoon, was much better with lots of colourful fish and exquisite-looking coral. Lunch was cooked on board the boat and it was the best diving meal either of us has ever had. Back on shore again, we went down to the hotel salon and got our hair cut. After months of dust and sand, my hair was a knotted mess. I merely wanted a simple trim but they wouldn't accept that and in the end, I had to "choose a model" from their dozen or so magazines before they would start. Matt, sitting in the chair behind me, got the full treatment and was this close to getting his chin-hair threaded - didn't even know he had any! I had to bite my lip from not bursting out in laughter when I saw his face in the mirror as the male hairdresser closed in on him with this long piece of white thread, ready to attack. He quickly - and very diplomatically - refused. Dinner was another feast. Now, back in our comfortable room, it's only 9:30 but like Matt said in his email back home: "Apart from sleeping, the options are watching the Russian movie channel on the TV or joining the Italian tour group downstairs for 2 hours of 'Retro Dancing' with DJ Mido." So, goodnight. Start: Sea Star Beau Rivage, Hurghada, EGYPT. End: Sea Star Beau Rivage, Hurghada, EGYPT. Distance Traveled: 0 Road Conditions: - Temperature: cool and breezy on the water

We left our cushy resort hotel today, happy, well-rested and well-fed. We really appreciated the chance to have a couple nights of good, uninterrupted sleep. The past few weeks have really worn us down, physically and mentally, and it seems every moment we are not on the road we just collapse into a comatose state of existence. Traveling north to Suez city we didn't need to go in convoy. The road followed the Red Sea coast all the way; a fantastic mountain and sea road which reminded us of Chapman's Peak Drive in Cape Town. Opened in 1869 as the gateway between Europe and Asia, we stayed in a room in the Red Sea Hotel which faced the famous Suez Canal. Before dinner, we watched several huge vessels passing through the canal. Quite amazing. Start: Sea Star Beau Rivage, Hurghada, EGYPT. 12:00 End: Red Sea Hotel, Suez, EGYPT. 17:00 Distance Traveled: 375 km Road Conditions: good Average Speed: 77.6 km/hr Max Speed: 100 km/hr Temperature: nice humid sea breeze

Today was our last day of driving in Africa. I'm feeling a mixture of sadness for a long journey that is ending and one of anticipation for what is to come. We left Suez and drove due west, eventually going around Cairo on the Ring Road, the longest way but by far the smoothest option. We didn't want to risk going through the chaos that Cairo is so famous for. From my intended quick Cairo stopover last year which ended up being an unintended multiple-day stay, I knew Foxy would have much preferred the long and scenic route. Driving on the highway, we passed lots of billboards advertising BMW cars, Starbucks Coffee, KFC and Pizza Hut, perfume and even VISA credit cards! Unbelievable. It seems Egypt is about being BIG. The people, for instance, are much bigger. Not necessarily taller, but bigger, wider, heavier. Perhaps a product of a wealthier nation? It's not just the people that are big, but objects and buildings are much bigger here as well. It's difficult to describe, but the movie "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" keeps popping to mind, with me being one of the shrunken kids. I couldn't believe how many giant monuments and statues I was spotting every few hundred metres along the road. Besides the sculptures, fountains and archways, all with their huge awkward pieces of steel or wood jutting out from every angle, it seems the rule of thumb is: the grander and more ostentatious the structure is, the more beauty points it racks up. Egypt, a land of pharaohs and temples, was preparing us for the civilization we were about to re-enter. I was totally stunned when we pulled into a service station about 100 km away from Alexandria. There was a Kodak Film booth selling memory cards and photo albums, Century 21 representatives shoving glossy pamphlets in my face, and a bookshop with the latest issue of Cosmopolitan on display - you know, the one with Britney Spears posing in a teeny red dress. This was a bit much. I didn't expect to feel like this, especially since I was born and grew up in a society that endorses and embraces such consumerism. But it was shocking, to say the least. Add to the fact that I was shocked about being shocked, I'm still a bit speechless. Saying that, I can't deny that the neon lights and flashy signs didn't work their magic on me either; for lunch, I indulged myself and bought a big dark chocolate ice-cream cone. It was the home-made waffle cone, still warm from the griddle, that sealed it. ~~ We arrived in Alexandria in the afternoon and with our first sighting of the Mediterranean Sea, a feeling of pure joy and accomplishment stirred inside me. I could imagine Europe just on the other side of this beautiful mass of water. But the day wasn't finished yet. We spent the next several hours on a long-winded search for a hotel within our budget. I'll spare you all the nitty-gritty details here, but basically we were going up and down Alexandria's 20+km long coastline (this city is like one long thin line, only 3km wide, but with beaches as gorgeous as these, you can't blame them for this type of urban sprawl). With the sun setting and our hopes setting with it, we suddenly came upon the Maamura Palace Hotel on the western side of Alexandria. A bit run-down and slightly above our budget, we decided it was the best we could do today. Feeling a bit more energized after a shower, we walked across the street to have dinner at the more glamorous, better-maintained and more expensive resort hotel. While devouring our grilled chicken and pita, we were serenaded by, not the usual neighbourhood dogs, but by a talented entertainer/musician who played on his electric piano all night and sang in at least 4 different languages. He even did a set off Eminem's "8 Mile" soundtrack, I kid you not. Start: Red Sea Hotel, Suez, EGYPT. 11:40 End: Maamura Palace Hotel, Alexandria, EGYPT. 19:30 Distance Traveled: 408 km Road Conditions: good Average Speed: 108 km/hr Max Speed: 68.9 km/hr Temperature: nice salty sea air, very bearable

Today we went into the Marina Shipping office in the city centre to sort out the logistics of shipping Foxy from Alexandria to Venice. Driving in Alexandria is a horrible nerve-wracking experience. Defensive driving takes on a whole new meaning here. There are painted lines on the streets but the city may as well have saved the hassle and used the paint for touching up the run-down buildings on the Corniche instead. People here, and I'm including taxi drivers, bus drivers, men in suits on cell phones, and even fully-veiled women, seem totally and inexplicably incapable of driving in a straight line. If you try to stay in your lane, you just get honked at incessantly and eventually pushed to one side or another. Add to that the fact that jay-walking seems to be practiced on a sort of religious level, from the very young to the very old and fragile, you can get a little sense of what Alexandria traffic is like. ~~ If all goes accordingly, Foxy will leave on July 11th on the cargo ship, arriving at Venice port July 19th. Our flight from Cairo to Milan is booked for July 10th. Over dinner tonight, Matt and I came up with a plan of how we want to spend our 10 days in Europe while we wait for Foxy to arrive. Two vital factors come into play. One, we want a 'home base' where we can stay put for a few days without being a bother or burden to anyone. And two, we want to do something that is affordable. Since leaving Sudan we have been spending a lot more money than we had originally planned. So we have decided to spend our time at the Thornington chalet at the foothills of the Pyrenees in southern France. Peace, tranquility, a homey home-base and most importantly, price-marked items in grocery stores! It will be a good chance to collect our thoughts and let this whole trip sink in. Start: Maamura Palace Hotel, Alexandria, EGYPT. End: Maamura Palace Hotel, Alexandria, EGYPT. Distance Traveled: 0 km Road Conditions: ok except for the crazy fools behind the wheel of taxis and buses Temperature: "Pleasant with slight sea breeze" says Bonnie. "Almost bearable" says Matt.

Yesterday we bought our 2nd class train ticket to Cairo for tomorrow at 10am. But in fact we won't be able to use our tickets. After a day of sorting things out at the harbour and with customs, Matt has go tomorrow morning to prove to the police officials that he did not incur any driving offenses during his time in Egypt. Only then are we free to go and only then will Foxy be allowed to leave Egypt on the ship. More delays, more bureaucracy. But we expected this and we just have to do what we have to do. Our flight leaves from Cairo in four days and we will do everything necessary to ensure we are on that plane. ~~ Many Egyptians loathe to be called "African" and make it a point to differentiate themselves from their southern, more "black", brothers and sisters. We found Ethiopians to be very proud as well, and whenever they could, always made it a point to state that while they may be from the African continent, they were lighter-skinned and much more beautiful than other so-called Africans. This afternoon, an Egyptian woman at the cyber caf&#xE9; remarked in genuine horror, upon hearing we had just completed an overland drive up through Africa, "Oh my! You went to AFRICA?! How brave, I could never do that! What was Africa like?" I thought to myself, "Well, aren't we IN Africa?!" but decided not to say anything and instead nodded at her. ~~ Tonight, our last night in Alexandria, we are staying at the Crillon Hotel which is closer to the city centre. Without transport (we bid Foxy farewell at the harbour), it was better to be closer to the train station and restaurants/shops. With dodgy elevators, a reception room full of stuffed birds, cockroach-infested showers, lumpy foam beds, a mal-functioning fan and mouldy walls, the set price of 120 EGP ($22 USD) for a double room seemed about right. Start: Maamura Palace Hotel, Alexandria, EGYPT. End: Crillon Hotel, Alexandria, EGYPT. Distance Traveled: 0 km Road Conditions: - Temperature: mid-30's or so

We have joked on and off throughout this arduous journey how we need a vacation to unwind and relax. And well, we're about to get what we wished for: a summer holiday in France! I can't believe we made it, Cape to Cairo, accident-free and illness-free! Well, that is if you don't count the Tanzanian speeding ticket, several Foxy mishaps, and the hundreds of flea bites. This time tomorrow we will be sitting on a plane, taking off from Cairo International airport, bound for Milan where we will then pick up our hire car and drive the 800+kms to the Thornington chalet at the foothills of the Pyrenees in southern France. Once there, we will spend one week with the intention of doing absolutely nothing except sit on the balcony sipping chilled Blanquette de Limoux and nibbling delectable cheeses and chocolate pastries, visit local family friends in Courtauly village, and if we can summon the energy, go on the occasional hike in the mountains. As much as I'm looking forward to all of that, I am going to miss what has become 'normal life' on the road. More specifically, I'm going to miss swapping tips and information with other (overland) travelers. The whole journey has been like one big choose-your-own-adventure where you have to solve certain puzzles, revealed to you by the people you meet and the places you visit, before moving on to the next stage. Being so accustomed now to constantly be on the look out for a place, person, object, street, or building, I will miss that feeling of being on a quest. I will also miss the daily routine of getting up with the sun, setting a route plan, driving it, and then laying our heads down in a new town for another night's sleep, listening to the neighbourhood dogs perform their nightly arias. Every day has been so different, so colourful, and so emotionally intense in all possible forms. Matt said that he hadn't realized how hard the last leg of the trip, north of Kenya, was going to be. Perhaps doing it from North to South would have been easier, doing the 'hard bit' first. Still, after a lot of thought and consideration, we agree that the route we chose within the given time frame, the sights we saw and those we had to painfully decide to forego, we wouldn't have changed anything if we had to do it again. The past few days we have been wondering what kind of re-culture shock we will experience when we get to Europe and North America. Will we go absolutely crazy at seeing all the flashy fast food outlets with their drive-thru windows, the manicured lawns and white picket fences, the obedient pedestrians stopping at every red light, the absence of car horns, rooster crows, and donkey brays? Will we relish the fact that we can walk down the street at any time of day and blend in with the crowd? Will we miss getting that 'special attention', both the good and bad kind, where one minute we are pushed to the front of the queue at the customs counter because we are foreigners, and the next minute we are made to pay outrageous baksheesh to taxi drivers because we are foreigners? I don't know, but we're about to find out. Start: Hotel Longchamps, Cairo, EGYPT. End: Hotel Longchamps, Cairo, EGYPT. Distance Traveled: 0km Road Conditions: - Temperature: sticky humid

<!-- ENTRY BODY -->
Throughout this trip, Matt, Foxy and I have been blessed with the loving support from our family and friends around the world, many whom I know follow this blog closely. I'm very thankful for this because it has given me the extra push when I am too tired, irritated or just plain lazy to record every detail more accurately. In truth, without all your continuous support (in the form of emails, phone calls and virtual hugs), this journey would have been less meaningful. Life is meant to be shared, and this space has allowed me to do just that - thank you. ~~ And lastly, an extra special thank you to all the people we met along the way. Being caught up in your own day-to-day life as you are traveling the vast African continent, it seems ironic how easy it is to become oblivious to the 'headline news' in countries you are supposedly experiencing first-hand. During our three months on the road, South Africa saw some nasty retaliation against foreigners, Zimbabwe descended into a violent mess in the face of Presidential elections, Khartoum saw some heavy rebel fighting and experienced a tragic plane crash (just days before we arrived), Ethiopia faced some of its worst famine and drought in years, Kenya saw 15,000+ people killed in post-election violence, and just today, 7 members of the joint UN-African Union peace mission in Sudan's Darfur region were killed in an ambush. Why is it that it is usually the bad news that make the headlines? What I really want to stress is that, yes all of the above happened and they are tragic horrible incidents. However, the Africa I will remember and carry with me is about the generosity and kindness we were shown by locals, the people who don't make it on BBC or CNN, but who are changing the world in their own simple way. This may all sound like some cheesy Hallmark ad, but this journey has proven and confirmed to me what I've always believed: at the end of the day, the human spirit unites us all regardless of age, gender, colour, race, tribe, religion, language, and yes, even the number of children we (don't) have! Right, gotta wipe my eyes and catch a plane! xo, Bonnie

Beautiful city, architecture, food, people and wine. We did the tourist thing here to the max because well.. we are tourists. Do the gondola trip if you're ever in Venice. It's not so cheesy as you might think. Oh, but get a bottle of prosecco beforehand to drink on board. Think: full bottle of prosecco in 30 minutes while being punted down the canals of Venice = 3 hours of unadulterated giddiness afterwards.

Can this really be happening? A DAY after we pick up Foxy from the port in Venice and drive all day and halfway into the night to reach Albertville in France, she breaks down. The clutch does not engage. We had no option but to leave her at a garage this morning. We were lucky there was one just a few metres away from where we literally just stopped moving. We spent the day at the local McDonald's eating breakfast, and then lunch and dinner. It's the only place in town with free Wi-Fi access. We decided to sod it all and left Foxy in the care of the competent French mechanic and took the overnight train to St. Malo via Paris. We are awaiting the ferry across to Jersey, now. This is definitely not the grand entrance we wanted to make to end our epic journey. It feels like we're missing a big part of our threesome, and we are. But we'll spend a few days with family in Jersey, then head back down to the Alps to pick up Foxy. C'est la vie, n'est-ce pas?

We are in Jersey and so happy. What a fantastic surprise to see Claire and Anthony in Jersey as well! We spent 4 lovely days in glorious sunshine on the beach, grilling sausages at home, sailing in a freak storm and just catching up and enjoying each other's company. Coming to Jersey was the best decision we could've made. Tomorrow we head back to France by ferry and train it all the way down to Albertville. We hope Foxy is patched up and rested for her final leg of the trip. All fingers and toes crossed.

There are no words in the English language to describe how utterly devastated we are. The drive up from Albertville took a day but it was fairly smooth. We got Foxy back from the garage all fixed up except the driver's window doesn't wind up anymore. Minor detail. Just kilometres away from St. Malo, we decided to stop for the night (well, technically it was early morning by then) and get a couple hours of rest before catching the ferry tomorrow morning to Jersey. We set up the tent one last time for old time's sake and just as we were about to climb in, we noticed a fairly consistent drip drip drip coming from the fuel tank. Cue panic. The next couple of hours consisted of smelly diesel on clothes and skin and hair, a large tube of silicon sealant, and cold nightime chills which turned into early morning sunrise mist and frost. Is this a sign telling us that we aren't supposed to finish this trip? We are hoping and praying that the sealant will hold for the night and that the ferry officials won't notice the drip. They certainly wouldn't let us on the boat if they could see we were leaking diesel.

The Gods were smiling upon us, we made it onto the ferry. We changed our plans slightly and spent the month of August here. During that time, we sold Foxy to a young South African couple living in London. They plan to fix her up and take her down the continent next year. Full circle ending. Aren't those nice?

Since finishing our trip, we've been watching this Turkana video again and again, and thinking how much we miss it all, the driving, the landscape, the people, everything. This video is a wonderful memory of one of the highlights of our journey. Thanks C+C!

We have arrived in Nanaimo, British Columbia, CANADA, and are settling in nicely. It's our 3rd weekend here already and we're loving island-life so far. After a couple months of non-blogging action, I thought I would continue on my previous site, seeing as this one was only created for our Africa-overland trip. So for those who want to follow, you can go to: http://bonthorn.blogspot.com/

Today I finished my reports at work (utter relief!), cleared my desk (it is pretty impressive how I've managed to hoard so much paper and junk over the year), drank some wine at a farewell staff party (turned an instant shade of hyper-red after the first sip), and shed quite a few tears (it suddenly hit me that I will dearly miss the chaos and action-packed days at BLT, and especially the gossip and chatter that only an all-female staff can bring about!). <br> <br> A two month summer break is not a long time, but it will feel like part of me is missing. I have sincerely enjoyed working at Building Learning Together and like one of my colleagues said today, I was very lucky to have found the job.<br> <br> I will certainly miss my little guys, the ones I've worked with and nurtured during this developmental year. One of the little cuties asked someone if I was his mother the other day! The kid has bright red hair and about three hundred freckles on his darling face, but still... Well, I suppose I'll just have to find small children to give me bear hugs daily this summer...<br> <br> Summer is officially here. And boy are we excited for the upcoming two months!<br> <br> We will be travelling across the coutnry (well, to Ottawa at least) on our motorbikes. Me on my Honda Shadow 750 and Matt on his BMW R1150GS.<br> <br> After spending time in Ottawa and Toronto, we will be flying out to England where Claire (Matt's sister) will be getting married in Jersey. Following the festivities, we'll spend a week in northern France with both sets of parents, and then back to Jersey and Devon. Upon touchdown in Toronto in late August, we plan to take our motorbikes back to Nanaimo through the States, just in time for work/school to start.<br> <br> So during this summer holiday, I've decided to continue to blog on this site for the two reasons: it is extremely user-friendly, where photos can be uploaded in an instant, and the exact location can be pinpointed on the accompanying map, which i know our families like to see.<br> <br> *****<br> <br> Matt and I have decided to not be too hasty and leave on Saturday early morning instead of the intended departure of tomorrow. We'll have one more day to pack, attend to last minute home errands, call our families, and sleep in a comfortable bed.<br> <br> We learned that you shouldn't push anything (especially a start time) if it is not necessary. <br> <br> Hmmm... which makes me ponder the other lessons we learned from our African-overland roadtrip last year. Let's see...<br> <br> 1. I will not be buying a crate of baked beans to take on our journey as 'emergency rations'. No room in my saddlebags anyway.<br> <br> 2. I will be taking an eye patch for those times when I just need to shut the world away and sleep.<br> <br> 3. I will not be taking 500+ Q-tips. I don't even have an excuse for that one; maybe i thought I would have to scoop out pounds of dirt, sand and grime everyday. Definitely not this time. Luggage space is at a premium anyway. <br> <br> 4. I will try to record our journey this summer to the best of my ability. It is a different adventure in many ways (re: paved roads, motorcycle mode of transport, English speaking locals, Tim Horton coffee shops in probably every major town), and yet the feeling of anticipation and giddiness remains the same.<br> <br> Our aim is to catch the 6:30am ferry to Vancouver on Saturday. From there, we'll take the high road to Whistler, through Kamloops, Banff, Calgary.... and then we'll see. <br> <br> The only things that are certain is that we have 4500+ km to cover, we'll be camping every night in some campsite/field/farm and my bike can only go about 220km before needing a refuel (Matt's can go about twice the distance, as he'll proudly tell you).<br> <br> Our date of arrival is pending, estimated for July 8 or 9, but we certainly won't risk our safety to make that time... however, I did buy Ben Harper tickets for his performance at the Ottawa Bluesfest concert on July 9th. No need to rush, but it would be a shame to waste those tickets!<br> <br> For now, I'm simply excited to be seeing my country by bike, a journey I've wanted to do for a long time.

We managed to get most of our packing done by 3am last night... woke up today to finish up and ended up taking the 12:30pm ferry. We arrived in Horseshoe Bay (Vancouver) at 2:30pm and started riding towards the towering mountains.<br> <br> That's when the rain started. And it didn't stop the whole day. And so we decided to keep riding as long as we could and get a motel room for the night... somewhere...<br> <br> It's strange being in your own world and not being able to talk to anyone. Every corner we turned I would be like 'wow' or 'ahhh'.. Several times already I've gotten a bit teary-eyed at how beautiful the landscape is. When you're riding on a bike, you are consumed in your own world, and you feel like it's just you and the road and your million thoughts that are running through your mind.<br> <br> Still, there's only so much daydreaming and thinking you can do. The road ahead demands your utmost concentration. We took the SEA TO SKY highway from Vancouver, twisty roads and quite a lot of pre-Olympics 2010 construction (deep potholes and gravel, which basically translates to a mud bath - great for the BMW but not so Shadow-friendly).<br> <br> We passed the ski resort towns of Squamish and Whistler, then fueled up the bikes at Pemberton (and ourselves at the local McDonald's).<br> <br> Eventually, we stopped at the Hotel DeOro in Lillooet, "the little nugget of BC." There's free wireless internet and cable tv so we are very :) Oh, and there's a continental breakfast too which suits my morning coffee addiction just fine.<br> <br> Matt's gone next door for a beer while I'm feeling antisocial having just showered and sitting comfy on the bed.. We've got all of our soaked clothes and bags strewn across the room, hopefully it will dry overnight. Our gloves are so wet, all you have to do is squeeze them slightly<br> and a waterfall of brown silty water gushes out.<br> <br> It's definitely been one of those 'right into the deep end' kind of days. But oh, it feels so right to be here right now.<br>

Woke up to sunshine bliss and I had my coffee ready and waiting for me downstairs, so needless to say I was a happy girl.<br> <br> We rolled out of Lillooet at 10am, taking part of the Yellowhead route and then cutting down onto the Icefields Highway through Jasper National Park. We passed some some amazing mountains, beautiful lakes, rivers, waterfalls... again, all gorgeous.<br> <br> Gloves were still a bit wet from yesterday, so I was on the look out for any automatic hand-dryer in any public washroom along the way.<br> <br> All in all, it was a long riding day. It was pretty chilly with spots of intense heat and only a few minutes of rain now and again.<br> <br> 613km later, we rolled into Jasper past 10:30pm (local time, we crossed a time zone!)<br> <br> It was too late and too cold (1C degrees!) to camp.. well that's the excuse we gave ourselves. So we rode around for a few minutes and found one of the few B&#x26;amp;B's that still had vacancy.. apparently they are cheaper than hotels and inns here.<br> <br> Jasper definitely has that ski resort town feel with lots of young people and families on holiday. One of the major hazards were the tourists all looking up at the mountains or pointing at something in the shop, when really they should be looking at the road crossings and noticing the motorbike that is cautiously approaching them, not wanting to sideswipe them!<br> <br> We had dinner at the Dead Dog Pub &#x26;amp; Restaurant, one of the few places that was still serving food. And just as my mind and body were getting accustomed to the loud rock music and blaring TV, a huge contrast to my quiet day of riding for hours absorbed in my own peaceful thoughts, I wasn't quite prepared when I literally bumped into one of my old Katimavik participants, Dan Orchard! <br> <br> Originally from Barrie, Ontario, he has been out here for a couple of years now tree planting and currently between contracts. How random!! I haven't seen him since the day his group left Rockland. I loved seeing how happy and grown up he was, what a treat. And really, what are the chances of us meeting after so many years in a downtown Jasper bar on the same night!?<br>

Woke up to sunshine... what more could we ask for?<br> <br> Today we saw some raggedy mountain goats, a BLACK BEAR, a humongous icefield caravan at the Columbia Icefields, the famous Lake Louise (still gorgeous and serene from when i last came here 17 years ago).<br> <br> And then there were those awesome jagged mountains staring down at you in every direction, and oh, just a few billion trees scattered everywhere in between - for added effect i suppose, in case you weren't in complete awe already.<br> <br> We had a picnic dinner in Lake Louise and was just about to go to the campsite to set up our humble home, but we were told tented camping was not allowed at all in the park because of<br> the big bear threat. <br> <br> So the options were to find another pricey hotel/B&#x26;amp;B or keep riding for another 60km to Banff to the Tunnel Mountain campsite, and hope that the tent camping ban wasn't in effect there.<br> <br> So off we went, and actually it doesn't get dark until about 10pm so it was a really nice cool ride.... and oh, the smell of pine and cool summer breeze!<br> <br> Because Banff's population is much larger, scaring a lot of the bears off, and due to the fact that the Lake Louise valley is much narrower, making it more difficult for the bears to migrate elsewhere, camping was allowed.<br> <br> By 11:30pm, we had the tent set up at Tunnel Mountain Campsite. I'm sure it wasn't a full minute later that we were both already sleeping soundly.

263 km, a short day but a very windy one. After we left the Rockies, it immediately started getting very flat - and very very windy. <br> <br> Thunderstorms tonight so the decision to stay somewhere indoors was easy.<br> <br> I think the reason why we don't have cable tv at home is so we can binge on all the tv programs for free when we're staying in a motel. Survivorman, CNN, The Bounty Hunter, Wife Swap... who needs sleep eh?<br>

We camped in Maple Creek tonight, just past the Albertan border. It was Canada Day so most restaurants and gas stations were closed. We were lucky and met a guy who owned one of the gas stations and he opened up for us especially! Phew! We were taking the backroads back down to Highway 1 from Drumheller, so towns were few and far between and I was running fast out of petrol.<br> <br> The only restaurant open was the local chinese one - BUT OF COURSE!!!! But oh my, the food was genuine.. the owner started immediately talking Cantonese to me and Matt then wow'd the whole family with his Mandarin. The owner's from Guangzhou and moved here 12 years ago with the whole family, kids, siblings and even the old mama (grandma).... so typical of small towns here! <br> <br> We were joking how different Maple Creek is from China, and she joked that here she could swing a machine gun round and not shoot a single person but back in Guangzhou she could do the same and take out at least 800 people in one go!! She's definitely got the prairie humour after all these years! Couldn't have asked for a better meal at the end of a long hot day.<br> <br> You know the feeling you get after a long day's sail out in the open water? How you still feel like the floor beneath you is still rocking and swaying when you are really standing on solid ground? Well, after riding a whole day, i felt like i was still on the move with the trees and wind rushing by me.

It feels strange to not be riding today. But we said we should rest for a day, let the bikes rest too, do some much-needed washing, and see the local rodeo tonight!!<br> <br> It's raining and grey out there. We are holing ourselves in the campsite's laundry room listening to the Dixie Chicks and the Cowboy Junkies. <br> <br> We washed our clothes, ate breakfast ('bear paw' pastries and yogurt) and lunch (microwaved Campbell's Chunky Chicken soup), read the local paper and now just taking advantage of the free wi-fi here.<br> <br> Thank goodness we are not fussy people and can just amuse the day away in a painted white room with horrible plastic chairs.<br> <br> So far, the trip can be summed up as follows:<br> <br> 2626.4 km (some gravel and mud, but mostly smooth tarmac); 20+ gas up stops (all cheaper than on Vancouver Island); a few gallons of coffee; 200+ mp3 songs (heard at least 5 times each); 247 photos; 1 campfire (we actually had time last night!); 4 mosquito bites (and counting).

We zipped through Manitoba, only stopping to gas up in Brandon and eat at the first ever A&#x26;amp;W in the country (in Winnipeg).<br> <br> After our burgers and fries (oh, what i would do for a little variety at fast food joints... ), we got caught in a massive downpour so despite our rain gear, our boots and gloves and a lot of my clothes in my saddle bags got wet... But then sunshine! And when the sun shines here, it's HOT!<br> <br> The local rodeo in Moosamin last night was truly an unforgettable event. I think we were the only ones in bike gear and not wearing a cowboy hat. It was fantastic! A genuine glimpse into the rodeo culture.<br> <br> The rodeo continues all throughout the weekend.. Although we couldn't stay for it, we took part in the firemen's pancake breakfast this morning. Yum!<br> <br> We're staying at a homey B&#x26;amp;B tonight in Kenora. It's the first major 'town' after leaving Manitoba. Looking at the map, there is still quite a bit to go to get to Ottawa... Never really realized how big the province is. We crossed another time zone too, but that just means going to bed one hour earlier which suits us just fine.<br> <br> It was amazing to leave the prairies and then suddenly see trees again. I saw a black bear on the side of the road, and within a 30 minute stretch, at least 12 deer. The forest comes right up to the highway so you have to always be on the lookout for any wildlife that might suddenly run out.<br> <br> Off to bed now.... For someone who does nothing but sit and steer all day, I'm exhausted!

Good riding day, from what i can remember. The only picture we took (or Matt i mean) was this one of me coming out of the bushes after a pee stop. Fantastic.<br> <br> Oh, the other exciting bit I can recall is seeing a giant moose standing at the side of the road. They are ENORMOUS. And just such beauties.<br>

Single-laned highways, speeding trucks, unseasonably cold weather, horizontal rain, and wind - oh the WIND!<br> <br> Take all that, and throw in the need to be perpetually on 'high alert' for the deer and moose that dart out from the forest and you get a sense of how we're feeling by the end of the day.<br> <br> That has been our Ontario experience so far. We crossed into this humongous province a few days ago, and we're still trying to get around the Lakes!<br> <br> We are so close, 1023 km left to go. And that is why we need to be even more careful...."many a slip twixt cup and lip".<br>

Eleanor, her daughter-in-law Jia-mei and her two beautiful granddaughters, Yiliya and Laurasia, came to visit us at home. <br> <br> Eleanor has been a dear friend of mine since our teaching experience in Zhuozhou in Hebei province, China. It is always a pleasure to see her and catch up. There are certain people who you meet in life and go through intense experiences with, and because of that, those bonds just continue to grow stronger despite time and distance. Eleanor is one of those treasured friends.<br> <br> <br>

The day started with taking May and Grandma Wong for a spin on the Shadow. They loved it!<br> <br> Then it was off to a good dimsum meal with all our grandparents.<br> <br> And then began the mahjong marathon. Matt is getting to be a really good MJ player. And although I know the basics of the game, he is definitely more into it than me, and it's a great way to spend time with my grandmothers. Who wouldn't want a 'gweilo' grandson-in-law to give you money at a game you so enjoy winning?<br> <br> And then before we know it, it's dinnertime! So back we go to the same restaurant for dinner.<br> <br> What a day!<br>

Great family camping weekend of campfires (i think we must have burned the equivalent of a small forest), frisbee, swimming, volleyball, canoeing, hiking. And the main event of the weekend: eating.<br> <br> Some of us camped over night (me, Matt, Anice, Piyali, Calvin, Aunty Ivy, Uncle Hong). And others came for the day (Amy, Winnie, Uncle Francis, Aunty Judy, Grandma Wong, Uncle Kee, Aunty Kit, May, Kitty, Kinson). <br> <br> Despite a few cloudy/rainy moments, it was delightful. I believe I gorged myself to a new level, something I don't aspire to do again.<br>

We arrived in Toronto despite the tornado and lightening &#x26;amp; thunder storm. What a landing!<br> <br> Was I ever glad to be off that plane! I can't remember the last time i was ever sick but it is not pleasant.<br> <br> All i want is a bed now. Goodnight!<br>

A family bbq with all the grandchildren there, what a treat for Grandma! Being the oldest grandchild, I felt a bit old - and vertically challenged, but there you have it!<br>

We had high hopes and expectations for a good month in England<br> We had high hopes and expectations for<br> a good month in England. It did not disappoint. In fact, I am<br> starting to feel like Jersey is my second family home which is a very<br> nice feeling.<br> My conceptual map of the world has<br> expanded once more. Matt took me to St. Donats in Wales to visit his<br> old highschool, Atlantic College. Wales is gorgeous, with the rolling<br> hills of the Black Mountains, all dotted with white sheep.<br> We also ventured to Bridport and Bath,<br> and found our way onto Dartmoor for a nice walk..<br> We arrived about a week before the<br> wedding.<br> In Jersey we went sailing, swimming,<br> scrambling onto overgrown paths to the &#8216;Secret Beach&#8217;<br> <br> <br> blogspot<br> <br> <br> I&#8217;m full of cream teas, pasties, M&#x26;amp;S<br> special dinner meals, custard and crumble, homegrown veggies and good<br> cheap wine. <br> <br> Today we are turning round and heading<br> west to go home. In 6 hours we&#8217;ll be boarding a flight back to<br> Toronto<br>
